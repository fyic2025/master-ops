## Email 1: The Hook (Day 1)

**Subject:** Passive income for your beauty business?

**Body:**
```
Hi,

Quick question for {{company_name}}:

Would you be interested in earning 10-25% commission from your existing clients — without stocking any products?

Here's how it works:
→ We give you a custom QR code poster (free)
→ Display it in your space
→ Clients scan and order online
→ You earn commission on every order
→ We ship directly to them

Teelixir makes premium organic mushroom supplements (beauty from within, stress relief, better sleep). Perfect for wellness-conscious beauty clients.

300+ Australian beauty businesses already earning $150-500/month this way.

Interested? Takes 2 minutes to apply:

(Or if you'd rather stock products for 40% margins, that's an option too)

## Email 3: Objection Handler (Day 5)

**Subject:** Why you haven't replied (probably)

**Body:**
```
Hi,

I've reached out twice about the Teelixir Ambassador program for {{company_name}}.

You haven't replied, so let me address what you're probably thinking:

**"Sounds too good to be true"**
→ Fair. But we have 300+ partners earning this way. It's how modern DTC brands grow — we pay for access to your clients.

**"My clients won't scan a QR code"**
→ QR adoption is 85%+ now. Our data shows 8-15% of people who see the poster scan it. That's 8-15 potential orders per 100 clients.

**"I don't want to be pushy or salesy"**
→ You literally don't mention it. The poster does all the work. You're just offering an option for clients who care about wellness.

**"What's the catch?"**
→ No catch. We need distribution, you have clients. We pay you for access. Simple.

**"Takes too much time to set up"**
→ 2-minute application. We design the poster. You put it up. Done. Total time: 5 minutes.

**"What if nobody orders?"**
→ Then you made $0 and lost 5 minutes total. But realistically, if you have 20+ clients/week, you'll get orders. Math just works.

**"I'd rather stock products and make more margin"**
→ That's an option too (40% margins). But Ambassador has literally zero risk. Start there, upgrade later if it works.

Still on the fence?

Just reply "send me info" and I'll share:
• Example earnings by business size
• Sample poster designs
• Full partner testimonials
• Exactly how commission tiers work

Or apply directly: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_2025

Your call.

Jayson

P.S. - Honest question: What would you need to see/know to feel comfortable trying this?

## Email 4: Breakup (Day 7)

**Subject:** Closing your file

**Body:**
```
Hi,

This is my last email about the Teelixir Ambassador program.

I've reached out a few times, haven't heard back.

I'm going to assume it's not a fit for {{company_name}} right now, and I'll close your file.

Before I do, here's the TL;DR one last time:

• Earn 10-25% commission from your existing clients
• We give you a QR code poster (free)
• No inventory, investment, or selling required
• Takes 2 minutes to apply
• Zero risk (if nobody orders, you lost 5 minutes)

If you want to try it: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_2025

If not, no worries at all. I'll leave you alone.

Either way, all the best with {{company_name}}.

Jayson

P.S. - Reality check: In the 5 minutes it took you to read my 4 emails, you could've applied and had passive income starting this week. Just saying. 😊

## Why This Universal Sequence Works:

1. **Generic enough** to work for all beauty businesses
2. **Specific enough** to be relevant (mentions beauty clients, wellness)
3. **Focuses on the OFFER** not the business type
4. **Data-driven** (earnings, percentages, proof)
5. **Addresses objections** universally
6. **Low pressure** but persistent

---

## Campaign Settings:

- **Name:** Beauty Blast 2025 - Ambassador Program
- **Leads:** 2,200 (all 3 CSVs combined)
- **Schedule:** Mon-Fri, 8am-6pm AEST
- **Daily limit:** 540/account × 10 accounts = 5,400/day
- **Duration:** ~2 days to send all
- **Tracking:** Click + Reply (opens OFF)

---

## HubSpot Will Handle Segmentation:

Once synced, you can create lists like:
- "Beauty - Massage/Spa - Engaged" (is_massage = true AND email_open_count > 0)
- "Beauty - Hair Salons - High Intent" (is_hair_services = true AND email_click_count > 0)
- "Beauty - Cosmetic - Replied" (is_cosmetic_clinic = true AND is_replied = true)

**Much more powerful than separate campaigns!**
