# Master Operations - Business OS

> **Central command for running multiple businesses using AI-augmented systems and strategic frameworks**

## Philosophy

This Business OS is built on **Darren Viner's frameworks**:
- ACRA (Attract, Convert, Retain, Ascend) for growth
- Brutal prioritization over busy work
- Pattern detection over blind execution
- Strategic alignment over tactical wins
- Autonomous operations over manual processes

## Department Structure

Each department is a specialized system with:
- **CLAUDE.md**: System definition and workflows
- **README.md**: Quick reference and usage guide
- **skills/**: Claude Code skills for automation
- **logs/**: Data tracking and pattern detection

### Current Departments

## Operating Principles

### 1. Strategic Alignment First
Every action must connect to ACRA framework. If it doesn't attract, convert, retain, or ascend customers → Question if it's priority.

### 2. Pattern Detection Over Execution
Systems that detect drift are more valuable than perfect execution. Know when you're off-track before you waste weeks.

### 3. Autonomous Operations
Build systems that run without you. Your job is strategy, not operations.

### 4. Brutal Honesty
No participation trophies. Low scores reveal truth. Truth enables fixes.

### 5. Ship Over Perfect
Done and shipped beats perfect and delayed. Always.

## How to Use This System

### Daily
1. **Morning** (5min): Run `plan-day` from Productivity System
2. **Execution**: Work on Top 3 ACRA-aligned tasks only
3. **Evening** (5min): Run `assess-day` to log and detect patterns

### Weekly
1. **Review** (15min): Run `view-patterns` for trend analysis
2. **Adjust**: Course-correct based on detected patterns
3. **Plan**: Set next week's strategic focus

### Monthly
1. **Aggregate**: Compile weekly reviews
2. **Analyze**: ACRA performance by category
3. **Pivot**: Adjust strategy based on data

### Quarterly
1. **Strategic Review**: Are we growing in right direction?
2. **Department Audit**: Which systems need improvement?
3. **Goal Setting**: Next quarter's ACRA targets

## Success Metrics

### System Health
- [ ] Daily logging consistency >90%

## Getting Started

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
✅ Set up Productivity System
- ✅ Create folder structure
- ✅ Configure daily planning skill
- ✅ Configure assessment skill
- ✅ Start logging

### Phase 2: Calibration (Weeks 2-4)
- [ ] Build 7-day logging habit
- [ ] Calibrate ACRA scoring
- [ ] Identify personal patterns
- [ ] Refine workflows

### Phase 3: Expansion (Month 2)

### Phase 4: Optimization (Month 3+)
- [ ] Add remaining departments as needed
- [ ] Automate repetitive workflows
- [ ] Build predictive pattern detection
- [ ] Scale across all business ventures

## Best Practices

### DO
- ✅ Start with Productivity System only
- ✅ Build habits before adding complexity
- ✅ Trust the brutal feedback
- ✅ Let patterns emerge naturally
- ✅ Adjust system as you learn

### DON'T
- ❌ Build all departments at once
- ❌ Skip daily logging
- ❌ Inflate scores to feel good
- ❌ Ignore 3+ day patterns
- ❌ Over-engineer the system

## Troubleshooting

### "This feels like overhead"
→ Pattern: Infrastructure theater about productivity system
→ Fix: Each department should take <10min/day total
→ If more → System is too complex, simplify

### "I don't see value yet"
→ Need 7 days minimum for pattern detection
→ Need 30 days for trend analysis
→ System shows value through drift prevention, not daily wins

### "I keep ignoring the system"
→ Pattern: Avoidance behavior
→ Question: What is the system revealing that you don't want to see?
→ Fix: That discomfort = The system working

## Evolution

This is a **living system**. Expected to:
- Start simple (Productivity only)
- Grow based on needs (not wants)
- Adapt to business changes
- Remain brutally honest

**Remember**: This Business OS exists to keep you aligned with growth, not busy with systems. If the system itself becomes the work, you've drifted.
