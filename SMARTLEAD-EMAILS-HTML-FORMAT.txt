Hi,<br><br>

I've reached out twice about the Teelixir Ambassador program.<br><br>

You haven't replied, so let me guess what you're thinking:<br><br>

<b>"Sounds too good to be true"</b><br>
→ Fair. But we have 300+ partners earning commission this way. It's how modern DTC brands grow.<br><br>

<b>"My clients won't scan a QR code"</b><br>
→ QR adoption is 85%+ now (thanks, COVID menus). Our data shows 8-15% of people who see the poster scan it.<br><br>

<b>"I don't want to be pushy or salesy"</b><br>
→ You literally don't mention it. Poster does the work. You're just offering an option.<br><br>

<b>"What's the catch?"</b><br>
→ No catch. We need distribution, you have clients. We pay you for access.<br><br>

<b>"Takes too much time to set up"</b><br>
→ 2-minute application. We design the poster. You put it up. Done.<br><br>

<b>"What if nobody orders?"</b><br>
→ Then you made $0 and lost 2 minutes. But realistically, if you have 20+ clients/week, you'll get orders.<br><br>

<b>"I'd rather stock products and make more"</b><br>
→ That's an option too (40% margins). But Ambassador has zero risk.<br><br>

Still on the fence?<br><br>

Just reply "send me info" and I'll share:<br>
• Example earnings by business type<br>
• Sample poster designs<br>
• How commission tiers work<br>
• Full partner testimonials<br><br>

Or apply directly: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_massage_spa<br><br>

Your call.<br><br>

P.S. - Honest question: What would you need to see/know to feel comfortable trying this?

Hi,<br><br>

This is my last email about the Teelixir Ambassador program.<br><br>

I've reached out a few times, haven't heard back.<br><br>

I'm going to assume it's not a fit for {{company_name}} right now.<br><br>

Before I close your file, here's the TL;DR:<br>
• Earn 10-25% commission from your existing clients<br>
• We give you a QR code poster (free)<br>
• No inventory, investment, or selling required<br>
• Takes 2 minutes to apply<br>
• Zero risk (if nobody orders, you lost nothing)<br><br>

If you want to try it: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_massage_spa<br><br>

If not, no worries at all. I'll leave you alone.<br><br>

Either way, all the best with {{company_name}}.<br><br>

Jayson<br><br>

P.S. - Quick reality check: In the 5 minutes it took you to read my 4 emails, you could've applied and had a poster up already earning commission. Just saying. 😊

• Buying inventory<br>
• Using shelf space<br>
• Training staff<br>
• Doing any selling<br><br>

Sound too good to be true?<br><br>

<b>It's our Ambassador program:</b><br>
→ We give you a branded poster with QR code<br>
→ Put it in your salon/treatment room<br>
→ Clients scan, order premium beauty supplements<br>
→ You earn commission, we ship to them<br><br>

Products: Organic mushrooms for beauty (Tremella = "beauty mushroom", Pearl Beauty Tonic, adaptogens)<br><br>

Average partner earns $150-400/month passive income.<br><br>

Apply here (2 min): https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_hair_beauty<br><br>

SUBJECT: Beauty salons averaging $250-400/month

BODY (copy everything below):
Hi,<br><br>

Quick data on what hair & beauty salons are earning as Teelixir Ambassadors:<br><br>

<b>Average salon results:</b><br>
→ 4-8 orders per month<br>
→ $250-400 commission monthly<br>
→ Just from a poster in the salon<br><br>

<b>Why it works in salons:</b><br>
Your clients already:<br>
• Care about beauty & wellness<br>
• Trust your recommendations<br>
• Spend 30-60 min in your space (time to scan QR)<br>
• Want "beauty from within" solutions<br><br>

<b>The poster literally does the work:</b><br>
1. Client sits in chair<br>
2. Sees poster about mushroom beauty supplements<br>
3. Scans QR code<br>
4. Orders online (free shipping over $100)<br>
5. You get 10-25% commission<br><br>

No selling, no inventory, no hassle.<br><br>

<b>What partners love:</b><br>
✓ Complements their services (not competing)<br>
✓ Builds their wellness brand<br>
✓ Monthly samples to try products<br>
✓ Clients appreciate the recommendation<br><br>

Apply: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_hair_beauty<br><br>

If it doesn't work? Literally zero loss.<br>
If it does? $2,500-5,000/year extra income.<br><br>

------- EMAIL 1 (Day 1) -------
SUBJECT: Passive income opportunity for cosmetic practices

BODY (copy everything below):
Hi,<br><br>

Given your focus on cosmetic/aesthetic services, I wanted to share a zero-risk revenue opportunity.<br><br>

<b>Teelixir Ambassador Program:</b><br>
• Earn 10-25% commission on client orders<br>
• No inventory or upfront investment<br>
• Custom QR code poster for your clinic<br>
• We handle fulfillment & shipping<br>
• Monthly sample sachets (so you can try everything)<br><br>

We're Australia's leading organic adaptogen brand (8+ years, certified organic, third-party tested). Our products complement aesthetic treatments perfectly - think "beauty from within".<br><br>

Many cosmetic clinics & med spas use this to:<br>
→ Generate passive income from existing clients<br>
→ Offer wellness products without stocking<br>
→ Position themselves as holistic practitioners<br><br>

Apply: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_cosmetic<br><br>

(Takes 2 minutes, no commitment)<br><br>

P.S. - If you'd rather stock products for retail (40% margins), that option exists too. But Ambassador is the easy entry point.<br><br>

SUBJECT: Passive income for aesthetic practices

BODY (copy everything below):
Hi,<br><br>

Wanted to share how cosmetic clinics are using Teelixir's Ambassador program.<br><br>

<b>Why it works for aesthetic practices:</b><br><br>

Your clients already invest $300-1,500+ in treatments. They're HIGHLY motivated to support results with quality supplements.<br><br>

<b>Typical clinic results:</b><br>
→ 5-10 orders per month<br>
→ $300-600 commission monthly<br>
→ Zero inventory or staff time required<br><br>

<b>Perfect for your clientele:</b><br>
• Evidence-based adaptogens (not woo-woo)<br>
• Certified organic, third-party tested<br>
• Complements aesthetic treatments (beauty from within)<br>
• Premium positioning aligns with your practice<br><br>

<b>How it integrates:</b><br>
→ QR code poster in treatment rooms<br>
→ Clients scan while waiting<br>
→ We handle orders, shipping, customer service<br>
→ You get 10-25% commission<br><br>

<b>Products that resonate with aesthetic clients:</b><br>
• Tremella (internal skin hydration)<br>
• Pearl Beauty Tonic (skin radiance)<br>
• Schizandra Berry (skin nourishing)<br><br>

Apply: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_cosmetic<br><br>

Think of it as: $3,000-7,000/year passive income for putting up a poster.<br><br>
