A <a title=\"face serum\" href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/skin/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">face serum</span></a> is typically a light, fast absorbing liquid that usually contain less ingredients than face creams, for example mineral oil and thickening agents. Most of them are water based which make them great for oily skin. Most of the excess fluid is eliminated so you are left with a high concentration of active ingredients, which consist of tiny particles that are easily absorbed deep into your skin which means one tube should last you months! A face serum should be used in conjunction with a moisturiser to achieve the best results. The serum penetrates deep into your skin, while a moisturiser hydrated the outer layer, therefore they are the perfect couple. A face serum should be applied immediately after your toner, but before your moisturiser. Wait for the toner to be fully absorbed into your skin, which shouldn&rsquo;t take too long, and then apply your daily moisturiser.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; font-size: medium;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Choosing the right serum is as easy as 1,2,3. </span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; font-size: medium;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Firstly you have to choose one for your skin type, whether it be oily, dry, combination, sensitive or normal. </span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; font-size: medium;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Secondly you choose if there is any specific condition you need addressed. These can include redness, dull skin, age spots etc. </span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; font-size: medium;\" lang=\"EN-AU\">Finally you must choose one in your price range from a brand you trust. </span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: 'Tahoma','sans-serif'; font-size: 10pt;\" lang=\"EN-AU\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">The best face serum will smooth fine lines and reduce age spots, contain anti aging ingredients, antioxidants, peptides and skin brighteners. The right face serum will leave you feeling revitalized, radiant and wrinkle free. Buy Organics Online stock the <a title=\"best face serums\" href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/dr-organic/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">best face serums</span></a>, using key natural ingredients like rosehip oil, rose, argan oil and jojoba oil.

This versatile natural wonder offers a wealth of benefits for your health and beauty, inside and out.</p>\n<h3 data-sourcepos=\"7:1-7:20\"><strong>Health Benefits:</strong></h3>\n<ol data-sourcepos=\"9:1-14:0\">\n<li data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:327\"><strong>Boosts Energy:</strong>&nbsp;Organic coconut oil is a powerhouse of medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs).&sup2; These fats are rapidly absorbed and metabolised by the body, providing a quick and sustained energy boost. Studies suggest that MCTs can even increase energy expenditure and enhance physical performance, particularly in athletes.⁶</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"10:1-10:240\"><strong>Supports Immunity:</strong>&nbsp;The lauric acid in coconut oil exhibits potent antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal properties.&sup1; Research suggests it can strengthen immune function, potentially offering protection against various infections.⁷</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"11:1-11:247\"><strong>Promotes Skin Health:</strong>&nbsp;Organic coconut oil's moisturising and antibacterial properties make it a natural remedy for skincare. It hydrates dry skin, soothes irritation, and can reduce inflammation, making it ideal for conditions like eczema.⁵</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"12:1-12:200\"><strong>Nourishes Hair:</strong>&nbsp;The penetrative nature of coconut oil makes it an effective hair conditioner. It strengthens hair, reduces frizz, and promotes hair growth, according to dermatological studies.⁴</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"13:1-14:0\"><strong>Enhances Digestive Health:</strong>&nbsp;Coconut oil can aid digestion by stimulating the production of digestive enzymes and balancing gut bacteria.&sup3;,⁸</li>\n</ol>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"15:1-15:46\"><strong>Lauric Acid: Your Body's Natural Defender:</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"17:1-17:362\">Lauric acid, a key component found in coconut oil and other natural sources, plays a significant role in enhancing your immune system. This medium-chain fatty acid undergoes a transformation in the human body, converting into monolaurin. Monolaurin is known for its potent antimicrobial properties, making it a formidable agent against a wide range of pathogens.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"19:1-19:468\">The mechanism behind monolaurin's effectiveness lies in its ability to disrupt the lipid membranes of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, and fungi. This disruption compromises the integrity of these pathogens' cell membranes, thereby inhibiting their growth and replication. For viruses, monolaurin interferes with the virus's envelope, preventing it from attaching to and invading host cells. This action is particularly effective against lipid-coated viruses.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"21:1-21:387\">Additionally, monolaurin has been observed to disrupt bacterial cell membranes, leading to their eventual breakdown. This mechanism is effective against a range of harmful bacteria, including those that are antibiotic-resistant. The compound also exhibits antifungal properties, targeting the cell membranes of various fungi, thereby limiting their ability to thrive and cause infection.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"23:1-23:324\">In summary, lauric acid contributes significantly to immune defence through its conversion to monolaurin. This compound's ability to disrupt the cell membranes of a wide array of pathogens underlines its role as a natural, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, offering a protective barrier against numerous infectious agents.</p>\n<h3 data-sourcepos=\"25:1-25:39\"><strong>Skin Care with Organic Coconut Oil:</strong></h3>\n<ol data-sourcepos=\"27:1-30:0\">\n<li data-sourcepos=\"27:1-27:94\"><strong>Moisturiser:</strong>&nbsp;Apply directly to dry skin to lock in moisture and promote a healthy glow.</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"28:1-28:83\"><strong>Make-up remover:</strong>&nbsp;Gently massage onto the face to remove make-up effectively.</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"29:1-30:0\"><strong>Lip balm:</strong>&nbsp;Its hydrating properties make it a natural and nourishing lip balm.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 data-sourcepos=\"31:1-31:39\"><strong>Hair Care with Organic Coconut Oil:</strong></h3>\n<ol data-sourcepos=\"33:1-36:0\">\n<li data-sourcepos=\"33:1-33:101\"><strong>Deep conditioner:</strong>&nbsp;Leave in your hair for 30 minutes before shampooing for intense nourishment.</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"34:1-34:85\"><strong>Hair mask:</strong>&nbsp;Combine with ingredients like honey for a luxurious hair treatment.</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"35:1-36:0\"><strong>Scalp treatment:</strong>&nbsp;Massaging it into the scalp can soothe irritation and foster hair growth.</li>\n</ol>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"37:1-37:374\">Coconut oil is highly effective for hair nourishment due to its unique fatty acid composition. Its primary constituents, lauric acid and capric acid, penetrate deep into the hair shaft, providing essential moisture and protection. This results in reduced protein loss, a key factor in preventing hair breakage and dryness, thereby enhancing overall hair health and strength.</p>\n<h3 data-sourcepos=\"39:1-39:41\"><strong>Culinary Uses of Organic Coconut Oil:</strong></h3>\n<ol data-sourcepos=\"41:1-45:0\">\n<li data-sourcepos=\"41:1-41:89\"><strong><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/cooking-oil/\">Cooking oil</a>:</strong>&nbsp;Ideal for saut&eacute;ing, roasting, and baking due to its high smoke point.</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"42:1-42:81\"><strong>Salad dressing:</strong>&nbsp;Adds a creamy flavour and healthy fats to salad dressings.</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"43:1-43:79\"><strong>Smoothies:</strong>&nbsp;Enhance smoothies with a delicious richness and healthy fats.</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"44:1-45:0\"><strong>Popcorn topping:</strong>&nbsp;A healthy and flavourful alternative to butter for popcorn.</li>\n</ol>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"46:1-46:47\"><strong>Additional Benefits of Organic Coconut Oil:</strong></p>\n<ul data-sourcepos=\"48:1-50:0\">\n<li data-sourcepos=\"48:1-48:78\"><strong>Weight management:</strong>&nbsp;May help in reducing appetite and promoting satiety.⁹</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"49:1-50:0\"><strong>Athletic performance:</strong>&nbsp;MCTs in coconut oil may provide a quick energy source for athletes.⁶</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"3:1-3:32\"><strong>Cautions and Considerations:&nbsp;</strong>A Balanced Approach</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"3:1-3:292\">While organic coconut oil offers an abundance of benefits, it's essential to acknowledge and address potential concerns individuals might have before incorporating it into their routine. Two common points of discussion are its saturated fat content and potential impact on cholesterol levels.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"5:1-5:366\"><strong>Saturated Fat and Moderation:</strong> Organic coconut oil does contain saturated fat, primarily in the form of lauric acid. Although research suggests lauric acid may not impact cholesterol levels in the same way as other saturated fats, moderation is still key. Remember, excessive intake of any fat, saturated or unsaturated, can lead to unwanted health consequences.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"7:1-7:431\"><strong>Cholesterol and Individual Response:</strong> The impact of coconut oil on cholesterol levels can vary greatly from person to person. While some studies have shown neutral or even beneficial effects, others have observed slight increases in LDL (bad) cholesterol alongside an increase in HDL (good) cholesterol. It's important to remember that individual metabolic factors play a significant role in how the body processes dietary fats.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:431\"><strong>Consulting with a Healthcare Professional:</strong> The best course of action is always to consult with your healthcare professional before making significant changes to your diet, especially if you have pre-existing health conditions like high cholesterol or cardiovascular issues. They can help you determine if organic coconut oil is suitable for you and recommend appropriate consumption levels within your overall dietary approach.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"7:1-7:51\"><strong>Embrace the Versatility of Organic Coconut Oil:</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:467\">Incorporate organic coconut oil into your daily routine and experience its diverse benefits.

Its MCTs can help reduce appetite and increase metabolism, which may contribute to weight loss. However, it's important to remember that coconut oil is still a high-calorie food, so moderation is key.</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"15:1-15:49\"><strong>Q2: Is coconut oil safe for all skin types?</strong></li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"16:1-16:270\"><strong>A2:</strong>&nbsp;While coconut oil is generally safe, individuals with sensitive skin should perform a patch test. Those with oily or acne-prone skin might need to use it cautiously. Remember, everyone's skin is different, so what works for one person may not work for another.</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"17:1-17:65\"><strong>Q3: Can I use coconut oil for cooking at high temperatures?</strong></li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"18:1-18:230\"><strong>A3:</strong>&nbsp;Absolutely! Coconut oil has a high smoke point, making it suitable for high-temperature cooking methods like frying and roasting. This makes it a versatile cooking oil that can withstand a range of culinary applications.</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"19:1-19:74\"><strong>Q4: Are there any specific conditions that should avoid coconut oil?</strong></li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"20:1-21:0\"><strong>A4:</strong>&nbsp;Individuals with allergies to coconuts or those with specific heart conditions should consult with their healthcare provider before using coconut oil.</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"22:1-22:116\"><strong>Do you have any other questions about organic coconut oil?

These harmful chemicals, not only cause damage, but also considerably slow the production of new hair, leaving it damaged, split and frazzled. Natural shampoo, however, will promote new hair growth, from root to tip and leave your hair fuller and with more shine as the hair is complete and free from damage. Ingredients typically put in shampoos have been shown to reduce hair follicle size, irritate and disrupt oil glands, dry out the scalp and result in hair loss. However <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/hair/\">natural hair care</a></span> infuses natural oils, minerals and herb extracts instead, which naturally stimulate hair follicles for improved hair production, maintain moisture by complimenting natural hair oils and improve overall condition. </span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Sulphate free shampoo is also</span></h2>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VPvAA6bnGd8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Suitable for all hair types</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Suitable for all ages</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">A more natural and mild aroma</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">Environmentally friendly, as they contain biodegradable materials.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">A general rule of thumb is to look for a natural shampoo with less than 9 ingredients, as this is all you need, any more and you may have excess ingredients that will cause more harm than good. Some good ingredients to keep an eye out for are coconut oil, aloe vera, organic shea butter, beta gluten and organic tea tree oil as they all have proven, natural benefits, specific for your hair.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">BuyOrganicsOnline -&nbsp;<span>Wide range of natural shampoos</span></span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: medium;\">At Buy Organics Online we have a wide range of natural shampoos for all types of needs.

Common ingredients of super foods include healthy fats which are considered good for heart health, a high concentration of fiber and phytochemicals which give plants a deep rich colour.

    "description": "<h2>Save on Probiotics&nbsp;Products - Buy Online</h2>\r\n<p>Probiotics are live microorganisms (bacteria or yeast) that have been shown to help maintain a healthy balance of bacteria in the digestive tract. This is especially important because nearly three-quarters of your immune system is located in your digestive tract, so when that balance is upset, your health may suffer as a result. Ideally, there should be a balance of approximately 80% good bacteria and 20% percent harmful bacteria in your intestines. Unfortunately, factors such as diet, stress, illness, and exposure to toxic substances can affect that healthy environment. Antibiotic use can also significantly alter the bacterial balance in your gut. Although their main purpose is to kill harmful bacteria, antibiotics often kill the existing beneficial bacteria as well. This can lead to diarrhea and other intestinal issues. Likewise, using anti-bacterial soaps has the same effect&mdash;killing many good bacteria at the same time it kills the bad bacteria.<br /><br />Thankfully, not all bacteria are bad for us and this is especially true of probiotics.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What do probiotics do?</span></h3>\r\n<p>When consumed in sufficient quantities they colonise the intestinal flora, to help counter the spread of harmful micro-organisms and renew the bacteria population. Daily consumption of probiotics re-establishes and maintains a proper balance in the intestines. Some of the best probiotics available are found in live fermented foods such as keffir, sauerkraut and kim chee. In addition, there are also some marvelous <a title=\"probiotic supplements\" href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/amazonia/\">probiotic supplements</a> available that when consumed regularly, can have enormous benefits for your wellbeing such as:<br /><br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stimulating the digestive process and making it more efficient<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Enhancing lactose digestion and utilization<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Breaking down undigested foods, including carbohydrates, in the intestines<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Aiding absorption of nutrients, including B vitamins and vitamin K<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Neutralizing some of the toxic products produced during digestion and everyday toxins we encounter<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Promoting optimal bowel pH, assisting to balance the delicate flora<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Promoting regular bowel movements<br />&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Boosting immune function</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>WIth the obvious benefits that taking probiotics offer, you may be prompted to ask several questions in relation to their use. These would be:</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Which is the best probiotic?</strong></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>We are all different and our gut health is unique to us - so the best probiotic is going to be the one that delivers the best outcomes for your gut health. Take the time to understand&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>what the benefits are of taking a particular probiotic and match this up with what health outcomes you are trying to achieve,</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Is it Ok to take a probiotic everyday?</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>First and foremost it is important to understand that probiotics are not a magic pill. They can help improve gut health, however, it is important to understand what effect probiotics are likely to have on your system. At the most probiotics should be taken once per day, however, if you are in any doubt at all you should consult a physician.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>When should you take probiotics?</strong></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>As you may experience some loose bowel movements after commencing a course of probiotics, it s best to take probiotics after a meal as this will help to alleviate the symptoms to a degree.</span></p>\r\n<p>Here at <a title=\"Buy Organics Online\" href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> we offer various brands of organic probiotics such as <a title=\"NTS Health\" href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/nts-health/\">NTS Health</a>, <a title=\"Nattrition Organic\" href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/superfoods/\">Nattrition Organic</a> and Amazonia. Our probiotic supplements are available in capsule, liquid and powder form which can be taken directly or added to juice, smoothies or cereal. Supplementing daily with a high quality probiotic is by far, one of the wisest investments you can make in your health.<br /><br /></p>",

It is made by crushing raw cacao beans into powdered form.</span></p>\r<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is the difference between cocoa and cacao?</span></h3>\r<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>While both cocoa and cacao come from the same cacao bean, the difference is that cocoa powder has been obtained from roasted cacao beans. The cacao beans are roasted at ultra high temperatures. This can cause much of the nutritional value of the cacao bean to be lost in the cocoa manufacturing process.</span></p>\r<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Regular cocoa powder and chocolate have been chemically processed and roasted, which destroys a large amount of the antioxidants and flavanols.&nbsp; A recent study suggested that between 60% and 90% of the original antioxidants in cacao are lost through common \"Dutch processing\", used to reduce the bitterness, darken the colour, and create a more mellow flavour to chocolate, but unfortunately also eliminates a great deal of the nutrients. Non-organic cocoa (and non-organic chocolate) has also been treated heavily with toxic pesticides and fumigation chemicals, and may contain genetically modified (GMO) products.</span></p>\r<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Benefits of raw cacao powder</span></h2>\r<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Raw </span><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/superfoods/\"><span>Organic Cacao</span></a><span> on the other hand offers a plethora of benefits, and can be added to the diet in a myriad of ways such as adding organic cacao to smoothies and desserts, without the need for any guilt attached to its incredible taste. Some of the health benefits that Cacao has to offer include:</span></p>\r<ul>\r<li dir=\"ltr\">\r<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Contains over 40 times the antioxidants of blueberries.&nbsp; With an amazing ORAC score of 98,000 per 100g, vs blueberries at a mere 2,400.&nbsp; ORAC scores measure the ability of antioxidants to absorb free radicals that cause cell and tissue damage and can lead to diseases such as cancer.</span></p>\r</li>\r<li dir=\"ltr\">\r<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The highest plant-based source of iron known to man, at a whopping 7.3mg per 100g.&nbsp; This compares to beef and lamb at 2.5mg, and spinach at 3.6mg.&nbsp; Note the iron in cacao is non-heme (as is all plant-based iron), so to get the maximum benefits you'll want to combine it with some vitamin C, like oranges and kiwi fruit</span></p>\r</li>\r<li dir=\"ltr\">\r<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>One of the highest plant-based sources of magnesium, the most deficient mineral in the Western world.&nbsp; Magnesium is important for a healthy heart, and helps turn glucose into energy enabling your brain to work with laser-sharp clarity and focus.</span></p>\r</li>\r<li dir=\"ltr\">\r<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Contains more calcium than cow's milk, at 160mg per 100g vs only 125mg per 100ml of milk.</span></p>\r</li>\r<li dir=\"ltr\">\r<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A great source of four scientifically proven bliss chemicals - serotonin, dopamine, anandamide and phenylethylamine, which are associated with feelings of wellbeing, happiness, and can even alleviate depression.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r</li>\r</ul>\r<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How much cacao per day?</span></h3>\r<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It doesn&rsquo;t take much to get all the benefits you need from cacao powder.

In a society that is becoming more self-aware of what they are putting in, and on, their body, organic soap provides health-conscious individuals and families with a smarter choice.</p>\r<h2>Why Australia are choosing natural organic soap and other healthy skin products</h2>\r<p>Most people make it a focus to minimise the number of toxins that invade their bodies. To do so, they eat healthier food, they drink pure water and they breathe fresher air. However, what many don&rsquo;t realise is that toxins can enter the human body through the skin. This is problem most deal with when using skin care products and a key reason why many are making the switch to natural organic soap products.</p>\r<h2>The benefits of using organic soap</h2>\r<ul>\r<li>There are some wonderful benefits in using organic soap that will now be outlined.</li>\r<li>One of the best things about using natural soap is that these products are generally cruelty-free. This means that they are not tested on animals before being placed on the shelves and that they are likely not to contain any animal ingredients.</li>\r<li>For those with sensitive skin, organic soap is ideal. Where mainstream anti-bacterial soap can dry the skin out, all-natural products help to naturally moisturize the skin ensuring they remain soft.</li>\r<li>Crucially, natural soap is free of chemicals and pesticides. That this product contains all-natural ingredients means that, when washing your hands and face, you aren&rsquo;t exposed to unnatural chemicals that could be absorbed through the skin.</li>\r<li>Many organic soap products contain natural oils. These natural oils help us to relax as well as providing the added benefit of protecting our hands and body from bacteria.</li>\r<li>Natural organic soap products are environmentally friendly. This is not only because pesticides and chemicals and absent during production but also because the products are much more biodegradable than their less healthy alternatives.</li>\r</ul>\r<h2>Organic Soap Australia</h2>\r<p><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> has an extensive range of all-natural organic soap products from only the most trusted Australian and International brands.

    "description": "<h2>Chai - What it is and how to make it</h2>\r\n<p>What is Chai one might wonder? Chai is the Hindi word for tea. It is not only a word but also a way of life in India. Influence came from the British colonization that took place in India and helped develop the culture of tea. Famous for their tea consumption, the British tradition was quickly adapted in India but it is thanks to India&rsquo;s culture and love for spices that made Chai happen. Without their fusion of blends and spices into Indian tea, Chai tea would not be the delicious milky beverage that we consume today.</p>\r\n<h2>What is in a traditional Chai tea?</h2>\r\n<p>Chai consists of spices such as cardamom, ginger, cinnamon and many more. Not just that, it is usually black tea infused with the different spices and boiled to perfection. They then add milk and sweetener which results to the amazingness that we all know as Chai Tea. In India, one cannot help but see all the stands that are preparing chai right there for you, found in almost every corner. There are regions where you can find other variations of the chai tea, including adding green tea instead of the regular black one. Others will use a mixture of different teas into their chai while still including the rest of the standard ingredients from traditional chai.</p>\r\n<p>Chai enthusiasts know that a good chai tea calls for whole milk. The creamy consistency and rich flavor of whole milk is what&rsquo;s needed to bring out the flavors of the spices. Adding flavor to this concoction is through the use of sweetener. Usually, white sugar is the typical sweetener for the chai tea and helps bring out the spices flavors.</p>\r\n<h2>What to pair your chai tea with?</h2>\r\n<p>Much like the British, tea is usually accompanied by different snacks. Most of the times, it depends what time of the day you have your tea in order to pair it with the appropriate snack.</p>\r\n<p>Indian tradition calls for pairing chai tea with tiny sandwiches. It is common to pair your tea with deep-fried snacks such as samosas, pakora or murukku.</p>\r\n<h2>How to Make Chai</h2>\r\n<p>Suggested ways to prepare your chai tea is to let the water boil, add your preferred spices and then add your tea and sugar. Once you strain the spices out of the water, add your milk and voila. The perfect blend of milky and sweet tea is ready for you to drink.</p>\r\n<p>Satisfy your thirst with natural <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/organic-tea/\">organic tea</a>&nbsp;found here at&nbsp;<a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/\">Buy Organics Online</a>.</p>",

These all natural deodorant products just may leave the user feeling fresh and smelling great while eliminating the risk of damage due to exposure to aluminum compounds and parabens often found in mainstream alternatives.</p>\r<h2>The suggested benefits of natural deodorant stick products</h2>\r<p>There are several suggested benefits for the consumer that favours a natural deodorant stick over the more common products found in the major supermarkets. These benefits are:</p>\r<p>It may be an ideal product for those with sensitive skin. Because organic deodorant stick products do not possess the harmful chemicals found in mainstream products that can cause irritation and itchiness they might be suitable for those who frequently deal with these symptoms.</p>\r<p>Most are free from aluminum compounds. These compounds commonly found in non-organic body care products can cause bacteria to become trapped resulting in poorer body odour than would otherwise be the case. Because most organic deodorant sticks do not contain aluminum compounds they may reduce the risk of the development of poorer body odour.</p>\r<p>Most are vegan friendly and aren&rsquo;t tested on animals. Many mainstream body care products are not suitable for vegans and have been tested on animals. The majority of natural deodorant stick products are therefore a great choice for those who deem non-organic body care products to be unethical.</p>\r<p>They are traditionally friendly on the environment. Due to the absence of harmful chemicals, most organic deodorant stick products do not cause as much damage to the planet that we live on during the production phase.</p>\r<p>There are no parabens present in most natural products. Parabens create a disturbance in estrogen levels that can throw out hormone levels. The absence of parabens in most organic deodorant stick products ensures that this does not occur.</p>\r<h2>Deodorant stick Australia</h2>\r<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> there are many <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/deodorant/\">deodorant</a> products that are sourced from only the most trusted brands from Australia and internationally.

There are many reasons that plastic bottles are not the way to go and instead you should be using reusable stainless steel bottles in your everyday life. If you are still using plastic ones, have a look at why you should reconsider your choice and make the shift to stainless steel bottles instead.</p>\r<h2>Stainless Steel Water Bottles vs Plastic Water Bottles</h2>\r<p>Many argued that plastic bottles are more accessible and would not bother getting a stainless steel water bottle. This argument is pointless and we will tell you why. Let&rsquo;s have a look at some of the benefits that stainless steel bottles can bring to both your health and the environment at large.</p>\r<h2>Why use Stainless Steel Water Bottles instead?</h2>\r<p>Reason 1:</p>\r<p>First and foremost, let us start with how plastic bottles can reduce the quality of the water or any other drink you choose to consume from a plastic bottle instead of a stainless steel one.</p>\r<p>The reason why this happens is due to the toxic chemical used to craft a plastic bottle called BPA. BPA is filled with hormones that are prone towards cancer such as breast cancer and any other types of cancer that are caused through hormone imbalance.</p>\r<p>Reason 2:</p>\r<p>Another important reason to make the shift to stainless steel bottles is the recycling ability that the materials that they are made out of can impact the environment. Plastic bottles cannot be dissolved in the land and is causing more harm rather than making our lives easier. Instead, the stainless steel bottles are reusable and refillable therefore, there is no need to through it away with every use. You simply clean it up, sterilize it and refill it with all kinds of liquids you would like to consume.</p>\r<h2>Stainless Steel Bottle Australia</h2>\r<p>Are you still thinking about it?</p>\r<p>Purchase your refillable and reusable stainless steel bottle from trusted Australian brands and benefits from low prices and low shipping costs.</p>\r<p><span>Satisfy your thirst with natural&nbsp;</span><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/drinks/\"><span>drinks</span></a><span>&nbsp;found here at&nbsp;</span><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/\"><span>Buy Organics Online</span></a><span>.</span></p>",

In pre-Colombian times, they were a main component of both the Aztec and Maya diets, and played a prominent role in religious ceremonies. One tablespoon of the seeds was considered capable of sustaining a warrior for 24 hours. They originate from the desert plant Salvia Hispanica, a member of the mint family which grows in North, Central and South America. Consumed as early as 3,000 B.C., chia seeds were eaten as a grain, mixed with water, ground into flour, mixed into medicines, and pressed for omega-3 oil. This extraordinary tiny &ldquo;king&rdquo; of <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/superfoods/\">superfoods</a>, offers a complete nutritional profile of Omega-3s, balanced dietary fiber, complete protein, antioxidants and minerals and carries an amazing array of health benefits.</p>\r<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What benefits do chia seeds have?</span></h3>\r<ul>\r<li>Contain Omega-3 Fatty acids (compiled of 60% Omega-3s).</li>\r<li>Provide fiber beneficial for reducing inflammation, lowering cholesterol, and maintaining a healthy gut.</li>\r<li>Provide calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, and manganese.</li>\r<li>Provide antioxidants which ward off free radicals.</li>\r<li>Contain anti-cancer properties.</li>\r<li>Help lower food cravings in between meals.</li>\r<li>Hydrate the body.</li>\r<li>Can be used as an egg replacer (mix 1 TB chia seed with 3 TB water, let gel and can substitute for 1 egg).</li>\r<li>Has been shown to lower triglyceride levels.</li>\r<li>Can help regulate blood sugar.</li>\r</ul>\r<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Do chia seeds help you lose weight?</span></h3>\r<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>As chia seeds are naturally filling and have a high fibre content they help to limit overeating and as such can assist with weight loss.

The most widely recognised health benefit is its vital role in bone health. It supports healthy bones as they build up calcium stores over time. Additionally, it plays an important role in the prevention of osteoporosis.<span class=\"bbcode1\"> Apart from calcium, vitamin D is also important for bone health, where it actually assists your body to absorb more calcium.

You can also find small amounts of vitamin D in foods such as egg yolks, oily fish, oils, and some milks and margarines fortified with vitamin D.</span></p>\r\n<p>Next, calcium plays a vital role in heart and muscle health and supports nerve transmission and muscle function which maintains heart rhythm. Further benefits are believed to be the assistance in prevention of certain forms of cancer, such as breast cancer and ovarian cancer, in addition to helping the alleviation of PMS symptoms.

    "description": "<h2>What is Agave Nectar</h2>\r\n<p>Experience the great taste of agave nectar. Originating from Mexico, agave nectar has been cultivated from the tequila plant. It is popular as a sugar substitute due to its delicious flavour and the low glycemic index that it possesses. The low GI means that it is a better alternative to traditional sugar from those who suffer from diabetes. Although high in calories, agave syrup delivers a very sweet flavour sensation and contains a healthy amount of iron, fibre, calcium and zinc.</p>\r\n<h2>Organic Agave Nectar benefits</h2>\r\n<p>There are some exceptional reasons why consumers may want to consider using organics agave nectar instead of regular sugar. The benefits of regular consumption of this product include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It is high in iron. Because iron promotes the flow of oxygen from the lungs to other areas of the body, those who don&rsquo;t consume enough, can&rsquo;t make healthy oxygen-carrying blood cells.</li>\r\n<li>Agave syrup is a great source of zinc. Zinc is a mineral that is crucial in helping to heal wounds that a consumer may have suffered during their daily lives.</li>\r\n<li>It is high in calcium. This is a major benefit over traditional sugar because calcium can help to build and maintain healthy, strong bones. In addition, your heart and nerves also need calcium to perform at an optimum level.</li>\r\n<li>Saponins present in agave syrup can help reduce cholesterol levels that can provide positive health benefits by reducing the risk of heart disease.</li>\r\n<li>A good serving of this product can provide a high amount of fibre. Products that contain fibre can have a positive effect in reducing the symptoms that cause constipation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Agave Nectar Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> you can purchase agave nectar Australia products that have been sourced from only the most trusted brands in the industry.

    "description": "<h2>Coconut Water &ndash; Why you should make the shift</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Coconut water</strong> is now available everywhere and there is a massive hype surrounding it and the health benefits it provides. But is it really good for you and if yes, how?</p>\r\n<p>But first let&rsquo;s have a look at what <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/coconut-water/\">coconut wate</a>r really is and where it comes from. It is not as simple as breaking open a coconut and drinking what&rsquo;s inside of it. Coconuts need to be as young as 5-7 months old to be able to get the water out of them. Otherwise, if the coconut is too old, the water becomes the coconut &lsquo;meat&rsquo;. Therefore, the green young coconuts are what give us the most nutrient coconut water.</p>\r\n<h2>Coconut Water &ndash; Health Benefits</h2>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/25-IHz9r-Cw\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>Although the real thing is what&rsquo;s best for you, you can buy coconut water online anytime and get those nutrients from trusted coconut water Australia brands. Our range of coconut water brands offer 100% pure and organic coconut water and can actually be of high quality for the ones who cannot find nor have access to the real thing. You can also get bulk coconut water from our online store.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How is coconut water made?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Coconut water is a naturally occurring liquid in the coconut. In the early stages of the coconut&rsquo;s growth this water serves to suspend the coconuts endosperm which later matures and permeates into the fruit&rsquo;s rind. </span><span><br /></span><span>Coconut water is harvested by piercing the coconut shell</span></p>\r\n<p>For now, let&rsquo;s have a look at how coconut water can benefit your health.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is coconut water good for</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is said that drinking coconut water is even more beneficial than any sports drink. Coconut water contains less carbohydrates than sports drinks and as such is a better low sugar hydration option for both the athlete and the casual exerciser.&nbsp;While coconut water is famous for its valuable benefits it offers to athletes, it can also provide numerous <a href=\"https://juicing-for-health.com/coconut-water-brands-review\">health benefits</a> to every single one of us. Coconut water is rich in potassium and magnesium which help you stay hydrated and have the ability to reduce sugar levels in your blood.</p>\r\n<h2>Other coconut water benefits</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Coconut water&rsquo;s magnesium and potassium contents can lower blood pressure</li>\r\n<li>Packed in antioxidants that can stop our body from having an oxidative stress</li>\r\n<li>Provides the body with enough hydration and energy boost</li>\r\n<li>Promotes weight loss</li>\r\n<li>Prevents bloating by not keeping water stored in your body</li>\r\n<li>Can be consumed by diabetics since it can lower blood sugar levels</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How much sugar in coconut water?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Coconut water contains less sugar than sports drinks and much less sugar than most carbonated soft drinks and commercial fruit juice products. It does, however, contain some levels of sugar. According to Webmd.com unsweetened coconut water contains 1.3 grams of sugar per ounce. This is less than the average 1.75 grams of sugar in popular sports drinks.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How much coconut water per day?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>As with most products it is important to read labels before consuming. If you choose plain unsweetened coconut water labeled as containing less than 50 calories per serving, you should be able to consume two servings of coconut water per day.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p>Buy Organics Online is supplied with many trusted <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/healing-herbs-vine-bach-flower-remedy-10ml/\">coconut water Australia brands</a> and can only offer what&rsquo;s best to those looking to buy coconut water online.

    "description": "<h2>Feminine Hygiene products</h2>\r\n<p>While an essential part of women&rsquo;s health and fertility, many young women are unaware of the best feminine hygiene products available to make their lives more comfortable. There are a range of products out there to help women during menstruation and when experiencing other issues relating to their vaginal region.</p>\r\n<h2>What are the main types of feminine hygiene products</h2>\r\n<p>There are many types of feminine hygiene products that are available for women who are going through menstruation and experiencing other vaginal issues. The most popular types are:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Menstrual Cups &ndash; </strong>These personal hygiene products are small, delicate cups that can be inserted into the vagina, just below the cervix. They work by collecting menstrual blood that is exiting the vagina thus preventing leakage into an individual&rsquo;s undergarments. They come in two shapes; diaphragm shaped and bell-shaped.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Menstrual Pads &ndash; </strong>Menstrual pads are feminine hygiene products that are made of thin material and placed into the underwear to absorb menstrual blood following its exit from the vagina.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Panty Liners &ndash; </strong>Much like menstrual pads, panty liners are placed into the underwear to absorb blood after it exits the body. The major difference between panty liners and standard pads are that panty liners are made of softer, thinner material and considered more comfortable. This makes them ideal for use during the earlier and later stages of menstruation when the amount of blood exiting the vagina is minimal.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Incontinence Pads &ndash; </strong>For women who are experiencing urinary leakage, incontinence pads are a wonderful feminine hygiene product that are inserted into the underwear to soak up leakages leaving the person feeling fresher and more comfortable.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Tampons &ndash; </strong>A tampon is another method for dealing with your period. It involves the insertion of a soft cotton, cylinder-like shaped object into the opening of the vagina to stem the flow of menstrual blood.</p>\r\n<h2>Feminine Hygiene products Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> you can select from a wonderful range of feminine hygiene products that are supplied by only the most trusted manufacturers from Australia and around the world.

    "description": "<h2>Panty Liners</h2>\r\n<p>Feel fresh and clean with panty liners. Many women experience some discharge throughout the day even when not on their periods. This is often due to slight stress incontinence where a weakened urethra can leak when experiencing strain. Many women also find that panty liners are a better option to menstrual pads during the lighter days of their periods. This is because they are thinner than most pads and considered much more comfortable.</p>\r\n<h2>What are panty liners</h2>\r\n<p>So what are panty liners exactly? Panty liners are more comfortable options than menstrual pads that are often the desired choice of women looking for a cleaner, fresher feel during lighter period days and throughout the month to soak up small leakages. They can be used in combination with a tampon to ensure that any leakages that seep past the first layer of protection do not reach a woman&rsquo;s underwear.</p>\r\n<h2>Reasons to consider wearing a panty liner daily</h2>\r\n<p>There are several reasons why women choose to wear a panty liner every day. These reasons are:</p>\r\n<p><strong>It ensures you stay dry and fresh</strong> &ndash; Wet underwear can be a highly uncomfortable feeling for women due to normal vaginal discharge. Panty liners can ensure that your underwear remains dry.</p>\r\n<p><strong>It can save the day when your period arrives without warning &ndash; </strong>Having panty liners with you in your purse or handbag can be a lifesaver on days when your period arrives without notice.</p>\r\n<p><strong>It is ideal in the early or late stages of your period &ndash; </strong>For those days during the period where a menstrual pad feels a little excessive, a panty liner is perfect because you will not feel as uncomfortable as you would feel with a pad.</p>\r\n<p><strong>It is ideal for the active female &ndash; </strong>When engaging in exercise and on the move, there are moments where you are likely to lose bladder control. Panty liners are perfect in these situations.</p>\r\n<h2>Panty liners Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At Buy Organics Online there are a wide range of <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/feminine-hygiene/\">feminine hygiene</a> products available that are sourced from the most trusted brands from Australia and around the world.

    "description": "<h2>Menstrual Pads</h2>\r\n<p>Menstrual or period pads are an ultra-absorbent product that is worn by women who are menstruating, have experienced a recent abortion, or following vaginal surgery. The purpose of menstrual pads is to absorb blood that is exiting the vaginal region. They can also be worn by women experiencing urinary incontinence, which is a medical issue that results in the leakage of urine from the vagina.</p>\r\n<h2>How do period pads work?</h2>\r\n<p>Period pads are inserted into a women&rsquo;s underwear during the occurrence of a period to absorb blood. Unlike a tampon, it is placed externally providing greater comfort than the alternatives. Pads require changing when full, but the frequency of a pad change will largely depend on the stage of the period and whether the menstrual flow is light or heavy.</p>\r\n<h2>The two different types of menstrual pads</h2>\r\n<p>There are two main types of menstrual pads that are available for women to choose from. These two types are:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Disposable Menstrual Pads &ndash; </strong>Although materials used in disposable menstrual pads can differ greatly, most contain bleached rayon, cotton and plastics. The major negative to this type of pad is the difficulty with recycling. Due to the materials contained within, often the only safe way that these products are disposed of is via landfill disposal which can be detrimental to the environment. Although recently, many manufacturers have confronted this issue by creating disposal pads that are made with 100% cotton and therefore more environmentally friendly.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Cloth Menstrual Pads &ndash; </strong>Many environmentally-conscious consumers have made the switch to cloth menstrual pads which are washable and reusable. Often made from either cotton or hemp, these products do not need to be disposed of and are therefore not only a more environmentally friendly choice buy also much more cost-effective.</p>\r\n<h2>Period pads Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> there are a range of period pads available that have been supplied by the most trusted manufacturers from Australia and around the globe.

    "description": "<h2>Soothers - Your child deserves the best</h2>\r\n<p>Soothers are a necessary evil that mothers cannot simply avoid. While shopping for soothers for your newborn, you will encounter many options. Not all are good enough though. In a matter of fact, there are a lot of soothers out there made of non-natural products and will end up harming your child. Thus, it is preferred to make an educated decision before choosing a random brand of soothers, pacifiers, dummies or teethers.</p>\r\n<h2>What are Natural Rubber Soothers made of?</h2>\r\n<p>Natural Rubber Soothers, as the name indicates are made of natural rubber. Natural rubber comes from the <em><span>hevea brasiliensis</span></em> tree. When processed, it has many properties that make it suitable in adding into the making of soothers and pacifiers.</p>\r\n<h2>Rubber Soothers Benefits</h2>\r\n<p>When it comes to rubber soothers, you need to know how it can benefit your child and if safe to use.</p>\r\n<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at some of the benefits of natural rubber soothers:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Natural Rubber vs Silicone &ndash; Many soothers and pacifier manufacturers are using silicone in their products instead of natural rubber. The biggest difference, when it comes to silicone, is that it is more likely to tear whereas natural rubber consists of a single rubber piece which makes it much more long-lasting. If a pacifier or teether tears then it becomes a choking hazard.</li>\r\n<li>While being less likely to tear due to its rubber make-up, it is less likely for the rubber to have creases where bacteria will develop and become hazardous to use.</li>\r\n<li>Soothers and pacifiers must be designed in a way to facilitate breastfeeding. In the case where they are made out of rubber, the feel is similar to a woman&rsquo;s nipple. Therefore, it makes it easier for newborns to imitate breastfeeding and learn the process quicker than without the soother.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Natural Rubber Soothers Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At Buy Organics Online, you can find a wide selection of natural rubber soothers available from our trusted Australian brand called Natural Rubber Soother.

    "description": "<h2>What is Maca?</h2>\n<p>Growing in popularity by the day, many people are asking the question what is Maca? Native to Peru, Maca is a plant known in the scientific world as <em>Lepidium Meyenii</em>. It is a vegetable related to cauliflower, cabbage and broccoli and has historically been used in Peru for both culinary and medicinal purposes. The most edible portion of the plant lies in the root. It comes in several colours, most commonly white or black. In terms of taste, it has been described as possessing an earthy, nutty flavour.</p>\n<h2>In what forms does Maca come</h2>\n<p>Maca root is most commonly consumed in powder form but can also be found in capsule form or as a liquid extract. In powder form it is most often added to smoothies, oatmeal and sweets as a nutritional booster. In capsule form it is normally taken in the morning with a glass of water.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What is Maca Powder?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The powder comes from the dried Maca Root. It is the root of the maca plant that is the edible portion. The powder has an earthy nutty taste which is quite strong.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What is Maca Good For?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Maca is a traditional Peruvian food supplement that has been used traditionally to solve various problems. It has recently become popular with musclebuilders as well as athletes. The powder has been associated with improved endurance, muscle gain and greater energy levels.</p>\n<h2>Organic Maca benefits</h2>\n<p>There are several organic Maca benefits that individuals who regularly consume it can receive. These benefits include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It is highly nutritious providing a good source of protein and carbohydrates while being low in fat.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">How to use maca powder and how to take maca powder</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It has been recommended that you take up to 20 grams of maca powder daily. However, most people will start with smaller amounts as they become accustomed to the taste. As a broad guide one teaspoon of the powder equates to about 5&nbsp; grams. The powder can be used as an additive to smoothies and other recipes like bliss balls or added to oats.</p>\n<h2>Organic Maca Australia</h2>\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> there are a wide range of organic Maca products that have been sourced from only the most reputable brands from Australia and around the globe. One of nature&rsquo;s great <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/superfoods/\">superfoods</a>, Maca will make for a welcome addition to the kitchen pantry of any health-conscious consumer.</p>",

The perfect complement to your organic hair care and body care arsenal, natural perfume oil provides a hypoallergenic choice which allows those with skin allergies and sensitivities to enjoy wonderful smelling oil fragrances without compromising on quality or ethics.</p>\r\n<h2>The benefits in choosing organic perfume oils</h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;The advantages of using, all-natural organic perfume oils instead of synthetic perfumes are clear to see. The benefits are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Organic perfume oil rollon does not irritate the skin or nose. The organic scent is mild and uplifting unlike synthetic fragrance oils that may cause headaches, migraines and irritate the skin.</li>\r\n<li>Natural womens fragrance scents are 100% free of harmful toxins and pesticides that can irritate the skin and inflict damage on the lungs.</li>\r\n<li>Synthetic fragrances can cause environmental damage. The chemicals contained within synthetic designer perfumes can leak into our waterways causing irreversible damage while also damaging crops. In contrast, natural oil perfumes are free from the chemicals that cause such problems.</li>\r\n<li>Unfortunately, many popular designer fragrances still test on animals. Even where animals are not tested on, many signature scents are derived from animal ingredients. This is not the case with the majority of essential oils which are produced in the absence of animal testing or animal derived ingredients. This makes them the perfect vegan beauty product.</li>\r\n<li>Synthetic perfumes usually work to mask the scent of your skin whereas natural roll on perfumes work in combination with your skin to create a totally customized fragrance that is unique to you.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Perfume Oil Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a>, there are a wide range of organic rollon perfume oils available from the most trusted leading Australian and international brands.

    "description": "<h2>What are Natural Ear drops and how do they work?</h2>\r\n<p>Natural ear drops are a form of treatment used to soften and dissolve ear wax. Natural ear drops are generally oil or water based and can be used as a stand-alone treatment or in conjunction with ear candle treatment, syringing or irrigation.</p>\r\n<p>Ear drops work by thinning and softening ear wax to the point where it can effectively dissolve. In addition, natural ear drops provide lubrication for the outer layer of skin that lines the ear canal that ensures any wax present can be expelled out of the ear.</p>\r\n<h2>Ear drops as a form of first aid</h2>\r\n<p>When foreign bodies invade the inner ear, there can sometimes be an urgent need to expel these particles quickly. Therefore, first aid ear drops are an essential addition to any first aid kit. Having quick access to natural ear drops can provide immediate and effective relief where a foreign body has invaded the inner ear. Applying first aid ear drops can quickly expel the foreign particles from the area, eliminating danger and alleviating concern.</p>\r\n<h2>How to use natural ear drops</h2>\r\n<p>Simply apply natural ear drops as instructed in the manufacturer&rsquo;s directions that are normally listed on the packaging. Frequency and duration of treatment can vary with each product so take care to follow the instructions as directed.</p>\r\n<h2>Potential benefits</h2>\r\n<p>There are several potential benefits to applying natural ear drops. These benefits include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The effective removal of ear wax.</li>\r\n<li>Where successful they can prevent the need for more invasive treatment methods such as ear syringing.</li>\r\n<li>They are a relatively cheap treatment method as opposed to others that your GP may suggest.</li>\r\n<li>As a self-care treatment method, they do not require a prescription or regular follow-ups with a GP.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Ear drops Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online </a>&nbsp;you can purchase natural ear drops from trusted natural remedy suppliers.

Well, put simply it is a cleaning process that proponents suggest may clear the ear canals of excess wax and debris. Advocates of the method claim that ear candling can be beneficial by using the smoke of a burning wick to create a vacuum that helps to extract the wax and excess debris from the ear.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\r\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\">How do ear candles work?</h2>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Many people ask how do ear candles work? Well, the method is simple to explain. It involves placing a long candle into the ear. The external end of the candle is then lit which results in the whole ear becoming coated in beeswax. This creates a vacuum in the ear canal and, as the beeswax is being removed, the hope is that excess ear wax is drawn out with it.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\r\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\">What does ear candling do?</h2>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">The heat from the ear candles is meant to soften ear wax making it easier to remove.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\r\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\">Why you might use ear candles?</h2>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">As a form of alternative medicine there are both proponents and critics of the value of using ear candling as a form of ear care. Some users of the product have advised that it may help with:&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Clearing earwax build-up. Although earwax serves a purpose in protecting the inner ear from unwanted particles, problems arise due to excess build-up. Traditional treatments such as water pumping or the insertion of sharp implements can be invasive and uncomfortable. Using ear candles is an alternative that is free from discomfort.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">A reduction in earaches. Earaches generally occur due to inflammation within the ear canal. Those looking for a treatment method that does not involve the use of prescribed medication may find that ear candling provides an effective alternative. This is because the warmth inside the ear can ensure bacteria does not have the space to reside.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Relief of swimmer's ear. When water gets trapped in the ear canal, germs present in the liquid can cause an infection. This often is reported as severely uncomfortable. When ear candles are used, the warmth provided can remove the water build-up therefore reducing the chance for germs to survive.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\r\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\">Do ear candles really work?</h2>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">A quick Google search will reveal many health sites proclaiming that ear candles do not remove ear wax. However, there is some evidence to show that ear candles do soften ear wax, making it easier to flush out. Some of the more reputable ear candling sites actually state that ear candling softens the ear wax allowing it to be secreted naturally. This explanation would tend to give credence to the practice and perhaps explain why the practice dates back thousands of years in many different cultures.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\r\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\">Will ear candles help with fluid in the ear?</h2>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;\">There are some claims that ear candling may help to dry excess fluids in the ear. There is no scientific evidence to support this claim.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 25px; font-family: Montserrat, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #444444;\">Ear Candling Precautions</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">It is important that customers be aware of the need to take caution when using ear candles. It is recommended that you do not use ear candles unless in the presence of others. The act of inserting ear candles is safer when performed by a second person. It is also important to note that if you suffer from chronic illnesses and diseases that use of ear candles is not recommended.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Make sure to avoid using ear candles if you have tympanostomy tube implants or suffer from a perforated eardrum. This warning also applies to any kind of inflammation of the ear and its surrounding area. Please also be aware that occasional allergic reaction to the ingredients contained within this product have been reported. Where this occurs, irritating itchiness has been reported. In most cases, this allergic reaction can be relieved by using eardrops.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\r\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\">Is ear candling safe?</h2>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Using ear candles may present some risks, particularly if not used properly. Improper use could result in build up of candle wax in the ear canal, burns to the face and hair, or in some cases a perforated eardrum. Caution is recommended.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">We highly encourage you to consult a GP or health practitioner if you have any reservations about ear candling treatment.

Organic refers to the way farmers grow and process their crops. Organic farming encourages soil and water conservation and reducing pollution. It not only produces high quality, full flavoured produce but also helps look after our great green earth at the same time.<br /><br />For example instead of using GMO seeds and harmful pesticides to reduce weeds, organic farmers use natural herbicides and crop rotation to control weeds, meaning less harmful contaminants in and on your food. Organic produce has a fuller, more complete taste and the nutritional benefits of organic seeds, grains, beans and lentils are phenomenal.&nbsp; These <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">organic products</a> are perfect for the vegetarian looking for the most out of each and every meal or for the omnivore looking for diversity and nutrition packed meals.<br /><br />BuyOrganicsOnline has a wide range of organic food in this category, including soy beans, mung beans, buckwheat, split peas, celery seed, organic grains, barley, sesame seeds, millet, quinoa and wheat grain. Have a look though the following pages to find all you need to make fantastic, high nutrition meals delivered to your door.<br /><br />Vegan- our organic seeds, grains, beans and lentils are great additions to any vegetarian or vegan diet, helping your body get the most from what you eat and using that to fuel you through your day.<br /><br />Organic -&nbsp; organic grains are consciously farmed, and free from the harsh <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/additives/\">additives</a> which have been linked to digestive issues, weakened immune systems and overall ill health.<br /><br />Gluten free - these products are gluten free, so safe for use for anyone with gluten sensitivities.</span></p>",

    "description": "<h2>Shower Gel – Your shower essential</h2>\r\n<p>A Shower Gel (also known as bath gel) is the perfect substitute to your conventional soap bar. Introducing a shower gel in your bath regime will benefit you in many ways. Asides from the fact that shower gels are mainstream, nowadays consumers also have access to different kinds of scents. This makes it easier for you to choose from a variety of scents and purpose of shower gels that best fits and satisfy your needs. With consumers becoming more conscious as to what products they put on their body, organic shower gels are the best choice.</p>\r\n<h2>What are organic shower gels?</h2>\r\n<p>Organic shower gels are natural shower gels that include natural ingredients and omit chemicals usually found in regular shower gels. Bath gels that are classified as organic contain natural and organic ingredients such as oil extract, essential oils and natural fragrances.</p>\r\n<h2>Shower Gels Benefits</h2>\r\n<p>Shower Gels or Bath Gels can provide many benefits to you and your family. Let’s have a look at some of those benefits:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Shower gels are more efficient when it comes to their use since they come in packages that are less likely to be contaminated. On the contrary, soaps have immediate contact with individuals and are more likely to be contaminated from body residue.</li>\r\n<li>Since soap dissolves in water, with just a few droplets, soaps are reduced. This makes them less beneficial since you end up using more soap than what you actually need. Whereas in the case of shower gels, you have the control over how much you would like to use.</li>\r\n<li>Lathering with shower gels is much easier and satisfying since the gel consistency makes for more foam and makes you feel more refreshed and fragrant. It is easier to rinse off shower gel foams than soap foams.</li>\r\n<li>Soap bars tend to leave your skin less hydrated whereas shower gels keep moisture locked inside your skin for a smooth and better looking skin.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Shower Gel Australia</h2>\r\n<p>Choose from a wide variety of shower gels from trusted Australian and international brands.</p>\r\n<p>Satisfy all your cleaning needs from our <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/bath-and-shower/\">Bath and Shower</a> products at <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/\">Buy Organics Online</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Liquid Soap &ndash; Your multi-purposed soap</h2>\r\n<p>Liquid Soap is not your traditional soap. Our liquid soap range includes multi-purposed soaps such as liquid castile soaps. Each product is made up of different formulations that allow for a much deeper cleaning and to satisfy all your cleaning needs. Organic Liquid Soaps have many advantages over traditional bar soaps. In reference to their biggest difference of the latter being in solid form whereas liquid is not, this makes liquid soaps even more convenient and cost-effective. We will have a look at that in the benefits section.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is liquid soap and how does it compare to bar soap?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Put simply liquid soap is a manufactured soap brand in liquid form. Liquid soap was first produced in 1865 by what would later become known as the Palmolive company. It is preferred in some instance to bar soap for its convenience and comparative ease to keep wash areas clean from soap stains that dried vbar soaps can do. In practical cleaning terms there is no significant difference between a bar soap and a liquid soap.</span></p>\r\n<p>Some argue how natural body wash is almost the same with natural liquid soap. Their only difference is that liquid soap usually has a thicker consistency and it is mostly used in colder climates. Due to their thinner consistency, shower gels are recommended to be used in warmer climates.</p>\r\n<h2>Liquid Soap vs Shower Gel vs Body Wash</h2>\r\n<p>No one can declare which one is the best for you to use. Each has a different consistency, texture and soap formulation. In addition to the aforementioned reason and the different types of consumers that exist in the market, deciding which one to use is purely on individual preference. Although, one can make an educated decision based on the ingredients used in the making of each one. Especially, when it comes to allergies or ingredient preference.</p>\r\n<h2>Liquid Soap Benefits</h2>\r\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-8dbd2ab2-7fff-9ca1-517e-ed908e03199d\"><span>If you are wondering what are the liquid soap benefits then it&rsquo;s time for us to.&nbsp;</span></span>Lets have a look at some benefits that liquid soap has over the other types of soaps.</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Liquid soap, much like shower gels and body wash, is cost effective over bar soaps. You can control the amount of liquid you will use per bath/shower session. Whereas soaps usually soak in water which can reduce the amount of soap available.</li>\r\n<li>Some bacteria might grow on soaps due to their direct contact with the ones using it.</li>\r\n<li>Fragrance and moisture of liquid soaps react better in colder climates.</li>\r\n<li>Usually available in bottle dispensers which is more convenient to be used.</li>\r\n<li>Lathering with liquid soap leaves a thin layer of moisturizer and fragrance on your skin. That is one of the reasons why most liquid soap fans prefer it over bar soaps.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How to use liquid soap</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>There are certain times when you simply must use soap, whether that be in liquid or bar form. Invariably, those times involve washing your hands.&nbsp; Most of these times are basic hygiene principles - before eating, after going to the toilet, after sneezing After handling pets, etc.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Simply washing is not going to do the job. Using liquid soap properly will ensure that&nbsp; the soap does its job effectively.&nbsp; Here is the best way to use liquid soap when washing hands.</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Wet your hands with warm running water</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Pmp the soap dispenser once to get a decent supply of soap and apply it to your hands</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Work the soap into a decent lather</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Spend a good twenty seconds rubbing the soap over your entire hand&rsquo;s surface including between your fingers, underneath your nails and extending slightly up to your wrists.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rinse your hands to thoroughly remove all traces of soap</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Dry your hands fully.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Liquid Soap Australia</h2>\r\n<p>Buy Organics Online proudly provides quality liquid soaps from Australian brands as well as international ones.</p>\r\n<p>Take care of your skin the right way with products from our <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/bath-and-shower/\">Bath and Shower</a> range, only at <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/\">Buy Organics Online</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>What is Agave?</h2>\r\n<p>Largely located in Mexico, agave is a syrup that is produced from the tequila plant. It is most popularly used as a sugar substitute and is much sweeter in taste. While slightly higher in calories per teaspoon than sugar, agave products are lower in GI and therefore may be beneficial to those with diabetes. Agave is a solid source of iron and contains a good amount of calcium. It is also a good source of zinc.</p>\r\n<h2>The benefits of agave products</h2>\r\n<p>There are several reasons why using agave in place of regular sugar may be beneficial to your health. These benefits are as follows:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The high source of iron is of great benefit to your body. Iron promotes the movement of oxygen from the lungs to other areas of the body.</li>\r\n<li>Organic agave contains a significant amount of zinc. Zinc is a mineral that is essential in the healing of wounds that you may have suffered in the undertaking of daily activities.</li>\r\n<li>There is a high amount of calcium present in this product. Calcium helps you to build and maintain strong bones while your heart and nerves also need calcium to perform at their best.</li>\r\n<li>Agave products also contain saponins. These compounds can bind to cholesterol and can help to lower cholesterol levels which can reduce heart disease.</li>\r\n<li>An ample serving of agave can supply a good amount of fibre that can help alleviate the symptoms that cause constipation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Agave Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> you can purchase agave Australia products that have been sourced from only the most trusted manufacturers. When it comes to <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/sugar-substitutes/\">sugar substitutes</a>, you can&rsquo;t beat organic agave with its rich source of iron, calcium and zinc that can provide many positive health benefits. Don&rsquo;t delay, purchase from Buy Organics Online and save.</p>",

The use of such products can assist a person affected by incontinence to live a fully functional life. These products can ensure that the person experiencing these issues remains dry, and more comfortable, thus improving their quality of life drastically.</p>\r\n<h2>What is urinary incontinence?</h2>\r\n<p>Urinary incontinence is the loss of bladder control that results in the leaking of urine. The severity of symptoms experienced by incontinence sufferers ranges from occasional urine leakage during a cough, sneeze or laughter through to frequent sudden urges to urinate. Where symptoms are severe, often a person cannot make it to the toilet in time resulting in a very embarrassing situation. There are several types of urinary incontinence that women experience, which are:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Stress incontinence &ndash; </strong>Where urine leakage occurs because of sudden pressure on the bladder as a result of coughing, sneezing, laughing or exercise.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Urge incontinence - </strong>Where a sufferer experiences an extreme urge to urinate that is generally followed by loss of control and subsequent leakage.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Overflow incontinence &ndash; </strong>The frequent and continual dribbling of urine that results from a bladder that does not empty entirely.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Mixed incontinence &ndash; </strong>A condition where an individual suffers from more than one of the above types of incontinence.</p>\r\n<h2>How to use incontinence pads</h2>\r\n<p>To use incontinence pads simply place the pad inside your undergarment. Please make sure to select a pad size that fits snugly to avoid leaks, rashes and abrasions. Disposable incontinence pads are convenient and easy to use but please ensure you consult a doctor prior to implementation.</p>\r\n<h2>Incontinence pads Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> you can purchase incontinence pads that are manufactured from the most trusted brands from Australia and internationally.

Slim tea, also known as slimming tea or detox tea, is a blend of herbs and spices traditionally believed to promote weight loss by boosting metabolism, curbing appetite, and cleansing the body. While there is scientific evidence to support some of these claims, it is crucial to approach slim tea with caution and consult with a healthcare professional before incorporating it into your routine.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"7:1-7:64\"><strong>Delving into the World of Slim Tea: A Comprehensive Overview</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:290\">Slim tea encompasses a variety of herbal teas typically made with a combination of green tea, oolong tea, and other herbs such as senna, dandelion root, and ginger. These herbs have been traditionally used for their purported health benefits, including weight management and detoxification.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"11:1-11:70\"><strong>Unveiling the Potential Benefits of Slim Tea: A Closer Examination</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"13:1-13:72\">Slim tea is often marketed for a range of potential benefits, including:</p>\n<ul data-sourcepos=\"15:1-22:0\">\n<li data-sourcepos=\"15:1-16:0\">\n<p data-sourcepos=\"15:3-15:331\"><strong>Metabolism Enhancement:</strong> Certain herbs in slim tea, such as green tea, may help to boost metabolism and increase calorie burning, potentially aiding in weight loss efforts. Studies suggest that green tea's catechins may promote thermogenesis, the process of generating heat in the body, which can increase calorie expenditure.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"17:1-18:0\">\n<p data-sourcepos=\"17:3-17:293\"><strong>Appetite Suppression:</strong> Certain herbs, such as fenugreek, may help to reduce appetite and cravings, promoting a sense of fullness and potentially reducing overall calorie intake. Fenugreek may act as an appetite suppressant by slowing down gastric emptying and increasing satiety hormones.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"19:1-20:0\">\n<p data-sourcepos=\"19:3-19:350\"><strong>Body Cleansing:</strong> Slim tea is often touted as a detoxifying agent, aiding in the elimination of toxins and enhancing overall health. While there is limited scientific evidence to support the detoxification claims of slim tea, some herbs may have diuretic properties that promote urination and water loss, which may be perceived as detoxification.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"21:1-22:0\">\n<p data-sourcepos=\"21:3-21:308\"><strong>Digestive Improvement:</strong> Some of the herbs in slim tea, such as ginger, may help to improve digestion and alleviate bloating, potentially promoting digestive health and overall well-being. Ginger may help to reduce gas, bloating, and indigestion by promoting digestive motility and reducing inflammation.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"23:1-23:70\"><strong>Harnessing Slim Tea Effectively: Embracing Proper Usage Guidelines</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"25:1-25:402\">Slim tea is typically consumed as a hot beverage, though it can also be enjoyed cold. The recommended dosage of slim tea varies depending on the specific blend and individual needs. It is generally advisable to start with one cup of slim tea per day and gradually increase to two or three cups per day, if tolerated. Excessive consumption of slim tea may lead to dehydration and electrolyte imbalances.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"27:1-27:68\"><strong>Navigating the Diverse Landscape of Slim Tea: A World of Options</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"29:1-29:155\">The world of slim tea is vast and diverse, offering a plethora of options to suit individual preferences and tastes. Some common types of slim tea include:</p>\n<ul data-sourcepos=\"31:1-40:0\">\n<li data-sourcepos=\"31:1-32:0\">\n<p data-sourcepos=\"31:3-31:281\"><strong>Green Tea:</strong> Green tea, derived from unoxidized leaves of the Camellia sinensis plant, is rich in antioxidants and has been linked to various health benefits, including weight management. Studies suggest that green tea's catechins may boost metabolism and increase fat burning.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"33:1-34:0\">\n<p data-sourcepos=\"33:3-33:276\"><strong>Oolong Tea:</strong> Oolong tea, partially oxidized, possesses a flavor between green and black tea. It is also rich in antioxidants and has been associated with weight management. Research indicates that oolong tea's polyphenols may promote fat breakdown and enhance metabolism.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"35:1-36:0\">\n<p data-sourcepos=\"35:3-35:297\"><strong>Senna Tea:</strong> Senna tea, made from the dried leaves of the senna plant, is a natural laxative that can promote bowel movements and reduce bloating. It is important to note that senna tea should be used sparingly due to its potential laxative effects and should not be used for extended periods.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"37:1-38:0\">\n<p data-sourcepos=\"37:3-37:355\"><strong>Herbal Blends:</strong> A myriad of herbal blends are available, marketed for their weight loss properties. These blends often contain a variety of herbs, such as dandelion root, ginger, and fenugreek. It is important to carefully review the ingredients of herbal blends to ensure suitability for individual needs and potential interactions with medications.</p>\n</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"39:1-40:0\">\n<p data-sourcepos=\"39:3-39:380\"><strong>Detox Teas:</strong> Detox teas are specifically designed to cleanse the body of toxins. They may contain herbs such as dandelion root, milk thistle, and burdock root. While there is limited scientific evidence to support the detoxification claims of these teas, some herbs may have diuretic properties that promote urination and water loss, which may be perceived as detoxification.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"41:1-41:60\"><strong>Sourcing Slim Tea Responsibly: Choosing Reputable Brands</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"43:1-43:370\">Slim tea can be conveniently purchased online, at health food stores, and in some grocery stores. When selecting a brand, it is imperative to choose a reputable company that adheres to high-quality ingredient standards, follows proper manufacturing practices, and provides third-party certifications, such as USDA Organic, to ensure the organic integrity of the product.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"45:1-45:65\"><strong>Addressing Common Concerns: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"5:1-5:41\"><strong>Q: Is slim tea suitable for everyone?</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"7:1-7:533\"><strong>A:</strong> While slim tea is generally safe for healthy adults, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional before using it, especially if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, or have any underlying health conditions. Certain herbs in slim tea may interact with medications or worsen existing health problems. Additionally, individuals with certain medical conditions, such as kidney or liver issues, should exercise caution when consuming slim tea due to potential interactions with their medications or underlying conditions.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:62\"><strong>Q: How long does it take to witness results with slim tea?</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"11:1-11:585\"><strong>A:</strong> The results of slim tea vary from person to person and depend on various factors, including individual metabolism, lifestyle habits, overall health status, and consistency with slim tea consumption. Some individuals may experience results within a few weeks, while others may not see any noticeable changes. Patience and consistency are key when incorporating slim tea into your routine. It is important to note that slim tea is not a magic bullet for weight loss and should be combined with a healthy diet, regular exercise, and lifestyle modifications for sustainable results.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"13:1-13:36\"><strong>Q: Can I consume Slim tea daily?</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"15:1-15:478\"><strong>A: </strong>While daily consumption of Slim tea is generally safe for healthy adults, it is recommended to start with a low dose and gradually increase to a higher dose if tolerated. Excessive consumption of slim teas, especially those containing laxative herbs like senna, may lead to dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and potential digestive issues. It is crucial to maintain adequate hydration by drinking plenty of water throughout the day, especially when consuming slim tea.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"17:1-17:55\"><strong>Q: What are the potential side effects of slim tea?</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"19:1-19:454\"><strong>A:</strong> Some potential side effects of Slim tea include diarrhea, nausea, stomach upset, and increased bowel movements, especially with laxative herbs like senna. These side effects are usually mild and subside on their own. However, if you experience any severe side effects, it is essential to discontinue slim tea usage and consult with a healthcare professional. Additionally, individuals with sensitive stomachs may experience discomfort or bloating.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"21:1-21:66\"><strong>Conclusion: Embracing a Holistic Approach to Weight Management</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"23:1-23:715\">Slim tea, a natural weight-loss remedy, may offer potential benefits when used with a healthy lifestyle. It is crucial to approach Slim Tea cautiously, be aware of the possible side effects, and consult a healthcare professional before incorporating it into your routine. Remember, weight management is a complex process that requires a holistic approach. While slim tea may be a part of your weight loss journey, for sustainable results, consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to develop a personalised weight management plan that is safe and effective for you.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"25:1-25:114\"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Please note that individual results may vary, and that slim tea is not a guarantee for weight loss.</p>\n<p>Please note: the information contained on this page is for informational purposes only and should not be construed as medical advice.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"3:1-3:14\"><strong>References</strong></p>\n<ul data-sourcepos=\"5:1-21:299\">\n<li data-sourcepos=\"5:1-6:0\">\n<p data-sourcepos=\"5:3-5:256\"><strong>National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health.

A common misconception when it comes to black tea&rsquo;s benefits is that it is less beneficial than other teas. Most prefer having green tea or matcha tea instead of black due to their health benefits. Although green tea is beneficial, black tea is also as beneficial with the only difference being how they are both processed. Green tea is not fermented whereas black tea is fermented.

It acts as medicinal. Consumers also wonder&rdquo; does peppermint tea have caffeine&rdquo; and the answer is no.

In fact, chamomile tea is much more than just that. It is rich in curating abilities and has numerous health benefits to offer to its consumers. Familiarise yourselves with what chamomile tea is and then read on for some of the benefits that it can provide to you and your family.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is Chamomile Tea?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Chamomile Tea comes from a family of plants/flowers, called Asteraceae. The process of obtaining the tea is simple, simply by drying the flowers of the plant and then soaking them in water to extract its delicious taste and divine smell. In case you are looking to introduce and regularly consume chamomile tea, we suggest preferring organic chamomile tea since it will offer the same nutritional value and benefits only without any chemicals and toxics found in regular tea. The organic chamomile tea is 100% pure and even better for you and your healthy lifestyle.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What does chamomile tea taste like?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The word, chamomile is actually derived from&nbsp; two Greek words - kamai meaning earth and melon which translates roughly to apple. The name gives a fair hint as to what it tastes like, hunting at a taste of apple with a gentle mellow sweetness. The taste is delicate and soothing.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How to make chamomile tea.</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Chamomile tea can be purchased in dry flowers or tea bag varieties. Making chamomile tea with a tea bag is done in exactly the same way you would make traditional tea using a tea bag.</span><span><br /></span><span>To make tea using dried flowers, use about a teaspoon of&nbsp; per cup. Place the dried flowers&nbsp; blossoms in a teapot or infuser, then pour boiling water onto the flowers and allow the solution to &ldquo;brew&rdquo; for about five minutes. It is possible to use freshly harvested chamomile flowers to make chamomile tea, but you will need to double the quantity as the drying process concentrates the flavor.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Chamomile Tea Benefits</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Organic chamomile tea is rich in content of powerful antioxidants that are mostly responsible for the many benefits of chamomile tea. Let&rsquo;s answer the question what is chamomile tea good for by&nbsp; taking&nbsp; a look at the health benefits of this delicious tea:</span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Most popular for the treatment of inflammation and spasms &ndash; The tea is mostly consumed when people suffer from bloating or cramp pain. It is perfect to treat muscle spasms, nausea and bowel pains.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Along with muscle spasms, the tea can also treat menstrual pain. Lower stomach cramp pain, caused during &lsquo;those&rsquo; days of the month, can be severely reduced and make you feel relieved. That is due to the antioxidants of the tea.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Another popular benefit and use of the chamomile is the treatment of migraines and headaches. Serotonin and melatonin consumed from the tea can reduce stress and lower your anxiety levels.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>On the line of relieving from anxiety and stress, it can also help you sleep. Perfect for those who have sleeping issues, insomnia or even new mothers.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It has been found that chamomile tea can strengthen your immune system through its many compounds it owns.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>May help to treat blood sugar levels in people suffering from diabetes. This does not mean that it should be used as a substitute for existing diabetes medications but could be used as a supplement to these medications.(1)</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It may contribute to the slowing of osteoporosis.(2)</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>There is anecdotal evidence that the inhalation of chamomile tea steam may help in combating the symptoms of the common cold. However, there has been no study done to support this claim</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>For even more benefits, check out the video below.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/2SqjR1qUEHo\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is in chamomile tea that makes you sleep?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>For many years now, Chamomile tea has been regarded as a mild sedative.

They are delicately perfumed with selective and healthful essential oils that moisturise and nourish the hair. Essential oils not only add fragrance to personal care products but contribute medicinal benefits as well. They help remedy a number of hair and scalp problems from dry, lifeless hair to dandruff and thinning hair. Essential oils added to shampoo can sooth and moisturise the scalp, stimulate the scalp and promote hair growth adding shine and softness to hair. &nbsp;</p>\n<p>The number one ingredient in all of Dr. Organic Shampoo Products is Aloe Vera.

Following are four reasons why the addition of Aloe in hair care products is an excellent hair treatment choice.</p>\n<p>1.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Aloe Vera can be useful in dandruff treatment and prevention. Just like Aloe Vera can sooth dry skin from sun burn, it can moisturise a dry scalp, which helps to alleviate the presence of flaky skin.</p>\n<p>2.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Aloe Vera is therapeutic for the treatment of dry, brittle hair. As a rinse it adds moisture without the worries of oil or product build-up.</p>\n<p>3.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Aloe Vera helps to tame frizzy hair while leaving your hair silky smooth and glossy. This is due to the high content of amino acids in Aloe which promote strength and adds shine to the hair.</p>\n<p>4.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Aloe Vera can help to prevent frequent hair loss and promote hair growth.

    "description": "<h2>Colloidal minerals</h2>\r\n<p>Colloidal minerals are used as a <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/dietary-supplements/\">dietary supplement</a> or as an additional source of essential trace minerals. They are a substance that is distributed microscopically through another substance to provide benefits to overall health and well-being and is typically consumed in liquid form.</p>\r\n<h2>The uses of colloidal minerals</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The term colloidal mineral can be quite confusing and leads to an obvious question - what are the uses of colloidal minerals? Being suspended in water colloidal minerals are easily absorbed into the bloodstream and as such they can be used for a range of reasons.</span></p>\r\n<p>There are a range of uses that colloidal minerals can provide for those that elect to consume it. Suggested uses include: to boost low energy, to reduce the symptoms of diabetes and arthritis, to counteract mineral deficiencies, to flush poisonous metals from the body, to reduce aches and pains and to improve general well-being.</p>\r\n<h2>Why do people need an adequate mineral intake?</h2>\r\n<p>It is extremely important for the human body to have an adequate amount of minerals present within their body. A body without minerals will struggle with digestion and the metabolic process. Scientific evidence points to the fact that most debilitating illnesses are caused by mineral deficiencies. If you require your body to perform at its maximum efficiency, then it is important to ensure your mineral intake is adequate. This is especially the case for those who experience allergies and food intolerances and are therefore unable to get the proper amount of minerals into their bodies.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What are the health benefits of trace minerals?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The body requires two types of minerals - macrominerals and trace minerals. Trace minerals like iron, copper and zinc&nbsp; are required in comparatively small quantities but are vital for the proper functioning of the body nevertheless. Science is becoming increasingly aware of the importance of trace minerals in maintaining bone, muscle&nbsp; and general health.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Is taking trace minerals dangerous</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>There is an old proverb that states that too much of a good thing can be dangerous and it certainly applies when talking about trace minerals. Overloading on any mineral can prove to be toxic. When considering taking mineral supplements of any kind it is wise to consult your doctor as to how much you should take. This certainly applies in the instance of trace minerals.</span></p>\r\n<h2>The suggested benefits of colloidal minerals</h2>\r\n<p>There are several suggested benefits that come with the consumption of colloidal minerals. These benefits include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>To improve your general health level</li>\r\n<li>To help stave off cold and flu</li>\r\n<li>To boost your immune system</li>\r\n<li>To improve skin health</li>\r\n<li>To increase energy levels</li>\r\n<li>To improve alertness</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>While the scientific evidence is mixed on the effectiveness of colloidal minerals in providing these benefits, many who consume this product have reported great results.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Are colloidal minerals absorbable?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The very nature of colloidal minerals makes them easy for the body to absorb into the bloodstream. Colloidal minerals are minute particles suspended in water. The minutes of the particles makes colloidal minerals more absorbable than a pill or powder supplement.</span></p>\r\n<h2>Colloidal Minerals Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a>, there are a range of colloidal minerals Australia products that are available for purchase.

One prominent study in Japan&nbsp;found that taking one or two tablespoons of vinegar per day over a twelve week period on average helped obese people to lose between 1.2 kilograms and 1,7 kilograms without any other changes to diet. This study would indicate that regular intake of apple cider vinegar can help you to lose weight.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 25px; font-family: Montserrat, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #444444;\">Amazing mother of vinegar</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">The &ldquo;mother&rdquo; is the dark, cloudy sediment in the Apple Cider Vinegar (ACV) formed from naturally occurring pectin and apple residues. It appears as molecules of protein (in the form of enzymes) connected in strand-like chains. The presence of the \"mother\" shows that the best part of the apple has not been destroyed. Vinegars containing the \"mother\" contain enzymes and minerals that other vinegars may not contain due to over processing, filtration and overheating. Many people believe it is the \"mother\" that is what provides so many health benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;Apple cider bragg is our preferred choice.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 25px; font-family: Montserrat, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #444444;\">&nbsp;Organic and never pasteurized</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar is never pasteurized. Pasteurization is the heating process intended to remove potential problem bacteria from consumable liquids such as milk, juices etc. However, this process will also remove delicate nutrients and enzymes that may constitute the major health giving properties of the food. In the case of Bragg Raw Organic Apple Cider Vinegar, pasteurization would eliminate the \"mother\", which contributes many healthy benefits. Similarly, Bragg AVC is not distilled.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">During the distillation process vinegar is turned to steam and the powerful enzymes are destroyed.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">This process also destroys the natural malic and tartaric acids which are important in eliminating toxins and harmful organisms. Bragg's is kept raw so all these beneficial properties are preserved. It's a wholesome way to add delicious flavor to salads, veggies, fish and chips, and other food favorites.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\r\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\">What are the Benefits of Apple Cider Vinegar?</h2>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\r\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Internal Use:</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Promotes Digestion &amp; Healthy pH Balance</li>\r\n<li>Natural Heartburn Remedy</li>\r\n<li>Rich In Enzymes</li>\r\n<li>Promotes heart health</li>\r\n<li>Vinegar for weight loss (apple cider vinegar diet)</li>\r\n<li>USDA organic</li>\r\n<li>Good for the immune system</li>\r\n<li>High In Potassium &amp; Other Minerals</li>\r\n<li>Helps Control Blood Sugar Levels</li>\r\n<li>Supports A Healthy Immune System</li>\r\n<li>Assists With Weight Control By Breaking Down fats</li>\r\n<li>Supports Bowel Regularity And Toxin Removal</li>\r\n<li>Soothes Dry Throat</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">External Use:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Helps Maintain Healthy Skin</li>\r\n<li>Soothes Irritated Skin</li>\r\n<li>Dandruff Remedy</li>\r\n<li>Relieves Muscle &amp; Joint Pain Due To Overuse</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">The source of Apple Cider Vinegar health benefits is the apple which has long been known as a nutritional powerhouse. It contains many vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and dietary fiber, while at the same time having very little fat and sodium.</span></p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 25px; font-family: Montserrat, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #444444;\">Organic raw unfiltered apple cider</span></h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Apple Cider Vinegar contains 5% acetic acid and much smaller amounts of Malic Acid, Lactic Acid, and various Amino acids. These acids give apple cider vinegar its antiseptic property, which helps deter the growth of unwanted bacteria and yeasts in the digestive track. By taking a little apple cider vinegar before a meal, you can increase stomach acidity and thereby improve digestion and nutrient uptake.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Some of the Vitamins, Amino Acids, and Bioflavonoids found in apples and Apple Cider Vinegar are antioxidants, which help protect the body against damage caused by exposure to chemical toxins. Additionally, apples and Apple Cider Vinegar contain Pectin, a water soluble fiber which can absorb water, fat, toxins, and cholesterol in the digestive tract and remove them from the body. Pectin also improves glucose metabolism and lowers blood pressure resulting in improved heart health.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">The insoluble fiber in apples aids digestion and elimination, promotes regularity, and contributes to bowel cleansing.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Apple Cider Vinegar also has significant amounts of easily absorbable minerals with potassium being by far the most plentiful. Potassium works together with sodium to control the body&rsquo;s water balance, the conduction of nerve impulses, contraction of muscles, maintenance of a normal heart rhythm, and is essential for the storage of carbohydrates and their breakdown for energy.</span></p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">All these natural benefits prompt a few natural questions which are:</strong></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\r\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\">Can I drink Apple Cider Vinegar Everyday?</h2>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Apple cider vinegar has tremendous natural health benefits and incorporating it into your daily diet is recommended.

These could include tooth decay (remember the cider is acidic, lowering potassium levels, feelings of nausea and other stomach upset related issues.

The process attracts and removes bacteria and toxins that typically reside in the oral cavity. With the help of saliva these undesirables bind with the oil and are readied to be disposed of when spit out after approximately twenty minutes. Traditionally pure sesame oil has been the oil of choice. Today many people choose coconut oil because the Lauric Acid and Monolaurin contained within the oil contribute potent anti-bacterial and anti-fungal effects.</p>\r\n<p>Oil pulling has been shown to significantly reduce cavity-causing bacteria, plaque, and bad breath while improving gum health. When swishing the oil within the mouth, the oil (especially oil with naturally antibacterial properties) binds to the bio-film or plaque on the teeth reducing the number of bacteria in the mouth. Streptococcus Mutans is one of the bacteria that is prominent in the mouth and it has been studied for its role in tooth decay and gum disease. Oil pulling <span>has been shown to reduce the number of Streptococcus Mutans bacteria in the mouth</span>, especially when done with coconut oil. Along with ridding the mouth of unhealthy microbes oiling pulling reduces plaque formation which alleviates inflammation, also known as gingivitis. Lastly, this totally natural ancient detoxification technique can eliminate halitosis. In many cases (but not all), bad breath is caused by the smell of chemicals and gases produced by bacteria in the mouth. With a reduction of odour causing harmful bacteria it is reasonable to expect a reduction in bad breath.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Technique: </strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Put &frac12; to 1 tablespoon of coconut oil into the mouth.&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Swish for up to twenty minutes. The amount of time is very important. Twenty minutes is long enough to break down plaque and bacteria but not too long that the body starts to re-absorb the toxins and bacteria.The oil will get thinner and milky as it mixed with saliva during this time and it should be creamy-white when spit out.</li>\r\n<li><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>Spit oil into a paper cup and dispose of in the trash can. Do not spit into the sink as it can clog the drain over time. Do not gargle with or swallow the oil as it is full of bacteria and toxins which need to be eliminated from the body.</li>\r\n<li><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>Rinse well with warm water. Slightly salted water works best.</li>\r\n<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Brush well to make sure remaining bacteria is removed.</li>\r\n</ol>",

For women, not only is personal lubricant effective at easing vaginal dryness and improving sexual activity but it is also beneficial in helping with the insertion of tampons and menstrual cups. In addition, lubricant can be used to prevent chafing during high-energy activities and to assist in shaving making it a valuable product for men as well as women.</p>\r\n<h2>Avoiding chafing and improving shaving performance with a personal lubricant</h2>\r\n<p>It has been well documented that many athletes, both men and women, have used personal lubricant to minimise friction from clothing rubbing against the body during a pro sports event. However, everyday Australian citizens can also benefit from applying personal lubricant prior to a gym session or yoga class for much the same reason. In addition, applying personal lubricant to your legs, face or chest prior to shaving can help to avoid razor burn. But there are other benefits to using lubricant as well, especially that which is all-natural.</p>\r\n<h2>The benefits of using a natural personal lubricant product</h2>\r\n<p>There are some key benefits to the consumer who chooses to use a natural personal lubricant over that of a non-natural lubrication product. These benefits include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Often non-natural lubricants contain sugar which when applied to the vagina can result in a yeast infection.</li>\r\n<li>Most natural lubricants are absent of chemicals that would otherwise be potentially toxic to sperm resulting in fertility complications.</li>\r\n<li>Not only kinder on your body and sexual organs, all-natural personal lubricant products are kinder on the environment as well.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Natural personal lubricant Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> there are a range of natural personal lubricant products available from only the most trusted brands from Australia and around the globe.

Despite conflicting information, particularly from overseas the short answer is no, oats are not gluten-free. Most oat products are processed alongside other gluten containing grains such as wheat, rye and barley. Therefore it is highly likely that many oat products that are called gluten free contain traces of other gluten containing grains due to cross contamination. It is impossible to find 100% gluten-free oats, but there are uncontaminated oats processed in facilities to avoid cross-contamination.&nbsp; These are the best options for sourcing lower-gluten oats.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">*Where oats are marketed as gluten-free and uncontaminated with wheat, rye or barley, they may still <strong>not be</strong> suitable for those who suffer from Coeliac disease. This is due to a protein called Avenin, and whilst they are considered naturally gluten free this protein is only safe for around 95% of people with Coeliac disease. In the US, UK &amp; Europe, oats that are labelled gluten free are considered safe for people with Coeliac disease and are classified as gluten free if they contain less than 20 milligrams of gluten per kilogram. Uncontaminated oats such as GF Oats are celebrated as a super nutritious food for people wanting low gluten and suffering with Coeliac disease <strong>in these particular locations</strong>. Every batch of GF Oats is tested to ensure they are below the thresholds applied for US, UK &amp; European markets. In Australia, </span><strong style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">different standards apply to be certified as gluten free </strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;\">.

The answer lies in part with the strict standards. The ASDA standards prevent oats from being labelled gluten-free. What other countries call gluten-free oats can only be labelled as wheat-free or uncontaminated oats. The strict controls are understandable as the risk factors associated with coeliac disease are quite severe.</span></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\">Are gluten-free foods good for you?</h2>\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Some considerable benefits come with the consumption of a single batch of gluten-free oats at breakfast time.

The root is grown on the ground and it is then roasted and ground into the amazing beverage that we enjoy as a coffee substitute. Without any of the caffeine that normal coffee has, it is the perfect solution for the ones looking for a coffee substitute. When roasted, the root turns into a caramelized color along with a much sweeter taste rather than the bitter one you get from regular store-bought coffee.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\r\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\">What is chicory in coffee?</h2>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px; background-color: #ffffff;\">Chicory is often added to coffee as a taste supplement or differential.

Some people have serious health issues when consuming a cup of joe and drinking a latte or flat white is simply torturous.

So those make it the perfect way to enjoy coffee. Why choose regular over organic? No one wants to consume chemicals and processed coffee when you can enjoy it in its purest form and as delicious as it already is. Also, there are millions of people who avoid caffeine and so what better way than enjoying decaf coffee that is 100% pure and certified organic. It not only is a great solution for those who avoid caffeine, it can also be extremely beneficial due to its pureness and being caffeine-free. Organic decaf coffee has been found to hold many health benefits that are being transferred into your body upon consumption.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is decaf coffee?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Decaf coffee is coffee that has been subjected to an extraction process that removes most but not all of coffee&rsquo;s caffeine content. While the coffee will still taste like coffee, the process does affect the taste, making decaf coffee taste milder and have a slightly different color to its original state.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is Organic Decaf Coffee?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Organic coffee is the coffee that is grown and cropped following the governing regulations that entitle any product as organic. The process of cropping and producing organic coffee includes not having any chemicals or additives added in the product or any contact with radiation contamination. What makes it decaffeinated is the fact that crops that produce organic coffee are then processed into removing caffeine and thus, labeling it as decaffeinated.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How is decaf coffee made?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Decaffeinating coffee usually involves a process of waterlogging green coffee beans in order to make the caffeine soluble. Then the caffeine is &ldquo;washed out of the coffee bean using one of several methods.</span><span><br /></span><span><br /></span><span>Companies that use chemicals to isolate the caffeine usually use ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. If the decaffeination process uses ethyl acetate that has been obtained naturally, then the process meets strict organic standards.</span><span><br /></span><span><br /></span><span>Another way to achieve decaffeination is to pump heated highly pressurised carbon dioxide through coffee beans. This method, perfected by German chemist Kurt Zosel had been widely used since the mid seventies up until the present day.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How much caffeine is in decaffeinated coffee?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>All brands of decaffeinated coffee will contain traces of caffeine. How much will be dependent upon where the coffee was grown and the decaffeination process itself. As a&nbsp; broad rule of thumb a standard ci[ of decaffeinated coffee (approximately 240ml) will contain about seven grams of caffeine. This compares to a standard drink of coffee that can contain anywhere between seventy and one hundred and forty grams of coffee. The key takeaway here is that drinking between five and ten cups of decaf coffee is roughly equivalent to drinking one or two cups of regular coffee.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Organic Decaf Coffee Benefits</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Organic coffee is even more beneficial over regular coffee. Having organic decaf coffee adds up to the benefits of organic coffee alone. Let&rsquo;s have a look at some of the benefits that organic decaf coffee can offer to its consumers.</span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Great source of antioxidants</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Filled with nutrients &ndash; It has been found that organic decaf coffee includes nutrients like magnesium, potassium and Vitamin B3 that can fulfill your daily intake.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Substitute suitable for pregnant women</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Stress relief</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span style=\"font-size: 10px;\">Organic Decaf Coffee Australia</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Enjoy the deliciousness of organic decaf coffee from trusted Australian brands as well as international ones.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Satisfy your caffeine cravings with </span><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/organic-coffee/\"><span>Organic Coffee</span></a><span>, only from </span><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/\"><span>Buy Organics Online</span></a><span>.</span></p>",

    "description": "<h2>Hemp Protein Powder &ndash; A great choice for vegans</h2>\r\n<p>With its high amount of essential amino acids that cannot be produced naturally, Hemp Protein Powder is considered the best choice for a vegan protein supplement. As well as being significantly high in protein, hemp powder contains a vast amount of healthy omega fats and fiber that many other organic proteins are lacking.</p>\r\n<h2>What is Hemp Protein Powder</h2>\r\n<p>Hemp Protein Powder is produced from the Cannabis sativa plant. Unlike its illegal cousin Marijuana, hemp seed has very little measurable quantities of the psychoactive compound THC. Empirical research has uncovered that THC when people are eating hemp has significant health benefits and very little in the way of side effects. Because organic hemp powder contains only a small trace amount of THC (normally between 0.3 to 1.5 percent) consumers do not run the risk of getting high.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you&rsquo;ve been wondering what is hemp powder used for, it is widely used as a vegan protein supplement and it can be added to a wide range of recipes as well as being a staple ingredient in many <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/smoothie-blends/\">vegan smoothies</a> and shakes.</p>\r\n<h2>What are the health benefits of organic hemp powder</h2>\r\n<p>There are some considerable health benefits that comes with the consumption of organic hemp powder as part of your healthy eating lifestyle. These benefits include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A sizeable increase in protein. Regular consumption of protein such as that found when eating hemp in powder form can help assist the body in the development, growth and maintenance of muscles. Furthermore, it can help boost your metabolism and increase the body&rsquo;s ability to burn fat.</li>\r\n<li>An improvement in overall heart health. The rich source of omega3 fatty acids in hemp protein powder leads to a boost in cardiovascular health. As hemp protein is high in fiber it can assist in lowering blood pressure, reducing cholesterol and heart disease</li>\r\n<li>A cleansed colon. The high amount of fiber in hemp powder, both soluble and insoluble, helps cleanse the colon by reducing constipation and helping to rid toxins from the body.</li>\r\n<li>Leads to a reduction in cravings for sugar. Due to its high nutrient content, hemp powder is ideal to fight off sugar cravings. As it can help regulate blood glucose, you are much less likely to experience a crash in energy and are not likely to turn to sugar to boost your fatigue levels.</li>\r\n<li>Inserting hemp protein powder into your diet can give your immune system a valuable spike. This is due to the presence of edestin and albumin which are crucial proteins responsible for stronger immune functioning.</li>\r\n<li>Animal friendly and cruelty free, organic protein powder is the perfect choice for vegans and those who are concerned about the treatment of animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>And if you&rsquo;ve been wondering &ldquo;Is hemp protein good for weight loss?&rdquo; There is much anecdotal evidence to suggest that hemp protein&nbsp; helps people to burn fat ,build muscle and lose weight. However, there is no conclusive evidence to support this. However, there is little doubt that taking hemp protein powder does make people feel fuller and more satisfied, thereby reducing hunger cravings and perhaps indirectly helping people to reduce weight loss.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Is hemp protein better than whey protein?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Both protein powders have their advocates. There are some clear differences between the two powders . The key differences are:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Hemp protein powder is a plant based powder whereas whey is a dairy based powder. This obviously is a key factor for vegans looking for the best protein powder.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>There are no additives in hemp protein powder while the production of whey powder necessitates the use of hexane to separate the powder. The no additive feature of hemp protein powder makes it easier to digest</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Perhaps the one key area that whey powder has a clear advantage is the amount of protein contained within it (over 90%) compared to 50% protein contained in hemp powder.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Hemp protein contains over 20 different amino acids and only contains unsaturated fats. Whey protein powder on the other hand contains saturated fats and traces of cholesterol.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A common question asked in relation to hemp powder is - does hemp powder have CBD? The answer is generally no, as the protein powder is made from the seeds of the hemp plant and CBD is present in the leaves and flowers of the plant.</span></p>\r\n<h2>Organic Hemp Protein Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a>&nbsp;you can get organic hemp protein powder from only the most trusted Australian and International brands.

    "description": "<p>Hemp oil, a product of the Cannabis sativa plant, is gaining traction in Australia for its health benefits. This article offers an in-depth look at hemp oil, from its nutritional value to its practical uses.</p>\n<h4><strong>Detailed Explanation of Hemp Oil's Nutritional Profile</strong></h4>\n<p>Hemp oil is rich in essential nutrients. It boasts a high content of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in a ratio optimal for human health. These fatty acids are crucial for brain function and heart health. Hemp oil also contains gamma-linolenic acid, known for its anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, it's a good source of vitamin E, an antioxidant that supports skin health. Quantitative data from sources like the USDA National Nutrient Database can provide more specific nutrient levels.</p>\n<h4><strong>Mechanism of Action</strong></h4>\n<p>The health benefits of hemp oil are attributed to its rich fatty acid profile and bioactive compounds. These components interact with the body&rsquo;s endocannabinoid system, which plays a role in regulating various physiological processes. The fatty acids in hemp oil help maintain cell membrane integrity and influence inflammatory responses.</p>\n<h4><strong>Evidence-Based Support</strong></h4>\n<p>Clinical trials and scientific studies, available on platforms like PubMed and the WHO, support the health benefits of hemp oil. For instance, studies have shown its effectiveness in improving skin conditions and reducing inflammation.</p>\n<h4><strong>Potential Side Effects and Interactions</strong></h4>\n<p>While hemp oil is generally safe, it can interact with certain medications and may not be suitable for individuals with specific health conditions. Potential side effects include digestive discomfort and allergic reactions. It's crucial to consult healthcare professionals before starting supplementation.</p>\n<h4><strong>Dosage Recommendations</strong></h4>\n<p>Dosage varies based on the health concern and individual factors. Starting with a low dose, such as 1-2 teaspoons daily, and gradually increasing is advisable. For specific conditions, consult a healthcare provider for tailored dosage advice.</p>\n<h4><strong>Quality and Sourcing</strong></h4>\n<p>The quality of hemp oil depends on its sourcing and production. Opt for products with organic certification and third-party testing to ensure purity. Products like <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/essential-hemp-foods-organic-hemp-oil-250ml/\" target=\"_new\">Essential Hemp Foods Organic Hemp Oil</a> are examples of high-quality options.</p>\n<h4><strong>Sustainability Considerations</strong></h4>\n<p>Hemp is a sustainable crop, requiring minimal pesticides and water. Organic farming and eco-friendly extraction methods enhance its environmental benefits, making hemp oil a sustainable choice.</p>\n<h4><strong>Comparative Analysis</strong></h4>\n<p>Hemp oil offers unique benefits compared to other natural remedies. For example, its omega-3 content is higher than in flaxseed oil, making it a superior choice for heart health. However, for specific needs like high antioxidant content, other supplements like rosehip oil might be more appropriate.</p>\n<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>\n<p>Hemp oil is a versatile and beneficial natural product. Its rich nutritional profile and potential health benefits make it a valuable addition to the wellness sector in Australia. Explore high-quality hemp oil products, such as those mentioned, for a holistic approach to health.</p>\n<h4><strong>References and Further Reading</strong></h4>\n<p>Explore in-depth information on hemp oil at:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/\" target=\"_new\">PubMed</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cochrane.org/\" target=\"_new\">Cochrane Library</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nccih.nih.gov/\" target=\"_new\">National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.who.int/\" target=\"_new\">World Health Organization (WHO)</a></li>\n</ul>",

    "description": "<h2>Fight off the bugs with natural insect repellent</h2>\r\n<p>Having flies, cockroaches and mosquitoes in the family home can be a frustrating experience. Often mainstream insect repellents can contain toxic ingredients that, when airborne, can pose a threat to the family. Natural insect repellents provide effective protection from bugs while also protecting the family from exposure to synthetic chemicals.</p>\r\n<h2>The benefits of natural insect repellent products</h2>\r\n<p>There are several benefits that natural insect repellents can provide to those who choose these over their non-organic counterparts. These benefits include:</p>\r\n<p>They are free of DEET. DEET is the most commonly found ingredient in most mainstream insect repellents and provides effective protection against most insects. However, empirical research has shown that DEET can have a negative effect on the central nervous system. Additionally, there is the added concern with DEET that it can infuse with other chemicals present in repellents to become even more toxic. Organic insect repellents do not contain DEET making them a safer choice for the concerned individual and family.</p>\r\n<p>Natural insect repellents are great for those with sensitive skin.

These benefits are:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">It is helpful with weight loss.&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Because erythritol contains almost no calories, it can provide benefits to those seeking to lose weight. By replacing daily sugar intake with erythritol, a consumer can reduce the number of overall calories they consume in a day considerably.</span></li>\r\n<li><strong style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">It can ensure blood sugar levels don&rsquo;t spike.&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">One of the major benefits of erythritol is that it has a zero glycemic index. This makes it extremely popular for people on low carb diets as well as those who are suffering from diabetes.</span></li>\r\n<li><strong style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">It will help keep you out of the dentist&rsquo;s chair.&nbsp;</strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">A major advantage of this sugar substitute is that it does not cause tooth decay.

Simply put, it is an all-natural sugar alternative. It is created through a fermentation process and has a taste that is very similar to sugar yet possesses almost zero calories. Historically, it was used in Japan during the early 1990s, not only as a sugar substitute, but in jellies, jams, chocolates and beverages. Erythritol is what is known as a sugar alcohol, similar to Xylitol, and these alcohols occur naturally within plants.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\r\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\">How healthy is Erythritol?</h2>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">On all the available evidence, erythritol appears to be a very healthy alternative to sugar and other sweeteners. Multiple studies have shown there to be little negative&nbsp;consequences from consuming the product.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">There is however, one area of concern and that is that as erythritol is a sugar alcohol, it cannot be digested and will pass through the body until it reaches the colon where the colon&rsquo;s bacteria will cause the sugar alcohol to ferment and generate digestive gases - this can lead to feelings of bloating, particularly when erythritol is consumed in significant quantities.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\r\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\">Is stevia and erythritol the same thing?</h2>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Although stevia and erythritol are both popular sugar substitutes and both obtained from plants they are not the same thing. Stevia is obtained from the leaves of a South American native plant&nbsp;Stevia Rebaudiana.&nbsp;It is usually made available in granulated, powdered or liquid form.

    "description": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What is natural organic peanut butter</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Organic peanut butter is made from all natural organically grown peanuts and other products without the aid of harmful chemicals or pesticides. Many brands of natural peanut butter have more nutritional value than conventionally made peanut butter because the manufacturers usually take extra care in sourcing the finest ingredients to go into their product. They also often cut down on sugar and salt content to give organic peanut butter the very best nutritional value.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Natural peanut butters generally contain at least 90 percent peanuts. No artificial colours, preservatives or sweeteners are added to the product, whereas traditional peanut butter or commercial peanut butter often contains additives such as hydrogenated oils, corn syrup, salt, sugar and soy protein.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Natural peanut butter in its purest form is a purely natural product and&nbsp; is not homogenized. As such it requires regular stirring and is sometimes referred to as stir peanut butter.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Commercial product manufacturers often produce a no stir natural variety that contains palm oil to act as a stabilizer. The palm oil prevents oil separation and helps to make the butter easier to spread and creamier in texture.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This slight difference in ingredient content and texture compared to regular peanut butter can take a little getting used to from a taste perspective. However, after a few servings, you will find that your taste buds will adjust.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Benefits of eating organic peanut butter</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The simple ingredients contained within peanut butter make it a perfect healthy addition to a quick sandwich, multiple recipes and even smoothies. Before purchasing from the grocery store, it is wise to read the jar to gain an understanding of exactly what you are buying. The jar should contain such important product information as salt content, additives and importantly state 90 percent peanuts. Keep an eye out for other information such as added sugar content. Some regular peanut butter products can have as much as 250 mg of sugar per tablespoon.&nbsp; When buying online this information and general nutrition advice can be obtained by viewing the product description</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The key benefit of choosing to eat peanut butter organic is the obvious improved dietary aspect. Peanut butter consumed in small quantities has several benefits - these are-:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Peanuts are rich in the &ldquo;good fats&rdquo; - monounsaturated fats that help provide nutrients to the body and reduce cholesterol</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Contains potassium and protein which helps to lower blood pressure</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rich in fibre content to aid bowel movements</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Also contains magnesium, antioxidants and Vitamin E.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Known to boost energy</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Minerals such as iron, magnesium and potassium aid better blood circulation.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Choosing organic peanut butter allows you to gain all these benefits while avoiding the potential risks that eating conventionally made peanut butter carries.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Where to buy organic peanut butter Australia can trust</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> has a wide range of quality&nbsp; organic peanut butter products to choose from.

    "description": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Himalayan Salt</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Himalayan salt is very similar to regular table salt. It is 98% sodium chloride, with the remaining 2% being made up of essential trace minerals. It is distinguished from other table salt products through its pink colouration.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What is Himalayan salt?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Pink Himalayan salt is thought to have formed millions of years ago as ancient seas evaporated. Hand labor and minimal processing are both used to extract the salt from the mines. As it is largely unrefined and additive-free, it is believed to be more natural than conventional table salt.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is mostly made up of sodium chloride; however, the natural mining process allows it to retain many other minerals that regular table salt does not contain.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It has been estimated that Himalayan salt may contain as many as 84 minerals and trace elements.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Why is Himalayan salt pink?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">But why is Himalayan salt pink? It gets its pink colouration from the combination of the three trace minerals potassium, magnesium, and calcium. These three minerals also explain the contrasting taste between Himalayan salt and regular table salt.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">Where does Himalayan salt come from?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the name suggests, the salt is mined from the Himalayan regions, most notably the Punjab region of Pakistan</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">The health benefits of Himalayan salt</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are some suggested health benefits that come from using Himalayan salt, particularly instead of regular table salt. These benefits include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It contains less sodium per teaspoon than table salt. Because of the larger crystals that Himalayan salt contains, there is less sodium per serving on average. Where excess sodium is present, blood pressure increases, which puts extra pressure on the heart and can cause significant health issues.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It contains more natural ingredients than table salt. While table salt is usually mixed with anticaking agents such as magnesium carbonate, Himalayan salt is far less processed and generally free of additives.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It can help you hydrate more effectively. Research has shown that adding a sprinkling of Himalayan salt to drinks and meals can help avoid dehydration.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It can improve respiratory ailments. Because salt contain anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties, it can loosen excessive mucus from the lungs while removing pathogens from the air, creating an environment that is easier to breath in.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Australia, we have seen a spike in demand for <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/celtic-sea-salt/\">Celtic salt</a> which has some helpful articles written to help you compare this as a viable alternative.</p>\n<h3>How to use Himalayan salt</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Himalayan salt can be used for both&nbsp; dietary and non-dietary purposes</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Eating and cooking with Himalayan Salt</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Himalayan salt can be used pretty much the same way you would use regular salt to cook or eat with. It goes well with sauces and marinades or can be added to food according to taste.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There are some instances of Himalayan salt being used as a cooking surface. It is possible to purchase large blocks of salt and use them to grill, sear meats, and cook other foods. This process gives the food an added salty flavour.</p>\n<h4 dir=\"ltr\">Non-Dietary Uses of Pink Himalayan Salt</h4>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The salt is an ingredient in some bath salts. Bath salts are said to offer many therapeutic benefits, including improving skin conditions and soothing sore muscles.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The salt is also often used to make salt lamps. These devices are said to help cleanse and purify the air.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Himalayan salt, Australia</h2>\n<p><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-7e039470-7fff-b1b8-d5a6-a7ed5e375459\"><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/\">Buy Organics Online</a> is the place to be if your looking to buy Himalayan salt in Australia.

The gel also appears to be harmful to certain varieties of fungi and bacteria. While packed full of vitamins and natural goodness aloe has not reached the heights of popular superfoods such as cranberries and pomegranates, this could be attributed to the fact that the clear gel or juice has a taste that could be best described as acquired.Despite its taste the juice has developed a reputation for aiding digestive health[9] and the immune system.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Uses and benefits of pure aloe vera gel</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Aloe vera contains organic natural ingredients that have known therapeutic and organic beauty properties.

However prolonged use at high levels can have some adverse effects including stomach cramps, diarrhea and in very rare cases, liver problems.

One common acne home health care treatment involves mixing aloe with two other antibacterial organic beauty substances - honey and cinnamon to make a face mask . Simply mix 2 tablespoons of honey with a tablespoon of aloe&nbsp; and then add a quarter tablespoon of cinnamon and then mix thoroughly.

Teas made from the leaves have an earthy, herby flavour.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">There are many home recipes for dandelion tea out there, however, while making your own may be appealing, it is important to remember that many dandelions may have been exposed to pesticides and other chemicals.

    "description": "<h2><span style=\"font-size: 1.5em;\">Parabens free Moisturizer</span></h2>\r\n<p>Parabens free moisturizer refers to moisturizer creams that do not contain any parabens. Parabens are chemicals induced in skin products to increase their shelf life which means that parabens act as preservatives and prevent mold and bacteria from growing. Along with the benefit of products lasting longer and keeping their form, comes the downfall of absorbing the negative effects of chemicals on your skin. Parabens might be great for their primary purpose but when it comes to using it on human skin, they harmfully react. The way that this type of chemical works is when in contact with human skin, it increases oestrogen levels and affects the human hormones.</p>\r\n<h2>Benefits of Paraben free Moisturizer</h2>\r\n<p>Now that parabens have been proven to cause negative effects in the long run, more and more skin care products have been available free of parabens. Let&rsquo;s have a look at how humans can benefit from paraben free moisturizers.</p>\r\n<p>Benefits:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Cancer growth - The biggest concern when it comes to chemicals in skin products is cancer growth. It has been studied how when oestrogen levels are increased, they are responsible of dividing cells which is a critical reason of cancerous cells to develop. Thus, choosing parabens free products will lower the risk of cancer.</li>\r\n<li>Potential risk of reducing birth rate &ndash; frequent use of paraben induced products can reduce sperm count and could possibly cause birth abnormalities. No use of paraben products will eliminate this risk.</li>\r\n<li>Skin damage &ndash; Parabens found in moisturizing products can possibly counter act to the moisturizing abilities and instead could cause skin conditions such as dermatitis. On the contrary, parabens free moisturizers shield the skin and protect it from developing such skin conditions.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<h2>Parabens Free Moisturizer Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At Buy Organics Online, you can find a variety of parabens free moisturizers from local Australian manufacturers as well as international ones.</p>\r\n<p>Purchase your <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/body-moisturizer/\">body moisturizers</a> at the best prices only at <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/\">Buy Organics Online</a>.</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Maternity Pads</h2>\r\n<p>Make life a little more comfortable post-birth with maternity pads. After child birth, it is important that women are as comfortable as possible. Following delivery, a mother will start to bleed very heavily during the uterus recovery process. Normally the bleeding experienced is much heavier than during her usual period and can last from 10 days to six weeks. This vaginal bleeding is known as <em>Lochia </em>and is the regular post child birth process experienced until all excess uterine surface and placenta is eradicated.</p>\r\n<h2>Why wear maternity pads?</h2>\r\n<p>Because the vaginal bleeding experienced is excessive and heavy, it is essential that women use maternity pads where they would otherwise wear standard menstrual pads or tampons. This is because maternity pads are larger, more absorbable and provide a greater level of comfort to deal with the excessive bleeding that occurs. Women must change their maternity pads often, not only to stay comfortable and fresh, but also to stave off infection.</p>\r\n<h2>Could I just continue to wear standard menstrual pads?</h2>\r\n<p>There is a considerable negative to continuing to use your standard menstrual pads following child birth. This is because standard pads do not provide as much absorption, are smaller in size and can irritate the skin where stitches are present. Maternity pads are much thicker in size, are longer to cover a larger surface area, and are much softer thus preventing irritation to a sensitive post pregnancy vaginal region.</p>\r\n<h2>How many maternity pads are required post pregnancy?</h2>\r\n<p>A pregnant woman will need to ensure that they have plenty of maternity pads with them post birth. The excessive bleeding that occurs will mean that regular replacements will be required. The general rule of thumb is to store 2 packets in your maternity bag to begin with and replace when necessary.</p>\r\n<h2>Maternity Pads Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a>, you can purchase maternity pads and a wide range of other <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/feminine-hygiene/\">feminine hygiene</a> products from the most trusted brands from Australia and around the world.

    "description": "<p>Cocoa powder, celebrated for its rich and intense flavour, is a staple in various culinary delights. From morning smoothies and coffees to cereal, the use of cocoa powder, particularly organic and unsweetened varieties, not only enhances flavour but also offers numerous health benefits.</p>\n<h2>Unveiling the Origins of Cocoa Powder</h2>\n<p>Cocoa powder's journey begins with the processing of cacao beans at high temperatures. The beans undergo fermentation and roasting, a critical process that differentiates cocoa powder from cacao powder, which is only fermented and not roasted. The finely ground and sifted product is what we know as natural cocoa powder.</p>\n<h2>Delving into the Nutritional Profile of Cocoa Powder</h2>\n<p>With approximately 15 calories per tablespoon (6 grams), unsweetened cocoa powder is a low-calorie addition to various dishes. Its nutritional density, including its rich content of flavonoids and antioxidants, makes it an excellent choice for a health-conscious diet.</p>\n<h2>Unmasking the Health Benefits of Cocoa Powder</h2>\n<p>The consumption of organic, unsweetened cocoa powder can benefit individual health when included regularly in the diet. It's known for improving heart health, offering antioxidant properties, enhancing mood, and boosting brain health.</p>\n<h2>Culinary Explorations with Cocoa Powder: A Versatile Ingredient</h2>\n<p>Cocoa powder is incredibly versatile. Beyond its common use in desserts, it can be a delightful addition to smoothies, coffees, and even savory dishes, thanks to its rich and intense flavour.</p>\n<h2>Tempting Recipes Featuring Cocoa Powder</h2>\n<p>Experimenting with cocoa powder in recipes can be an exciting culinary adventure. For those interested in creating their own cocoa powder, the process involves fermenting cacao beans, drying, roasting, and grinding them&mdash;a laborious but rewarding process.</p>\n<h2>Storing Cocoa Powder for Optimal Quality</h2>\n<p>To maintain the potent antioxidant properties and rich flavour of cocoa powder, it's crucial to store it properly. A cool, dry place away from direct sunlight is ideal for preserving its quality.</p>\n<h2>Discover the Difference: Organic Cocoa Powder vs. Cacao Powder</h2>\n<p>The distinction between cocoa and cacao powders is significant. While both originate from the same plant, the processing methods differ, with cocoa powder undergoing fermentation and roasting, leading to a different flavour and nutritional profile.</p>\n<h2>Embracing Ethical Sourcing: Fair Trade and Non-GMO Cocoa Powder</h2>\n<p>Choosing organic, fair trade, and non-GMO cocoa powder not only ensures a quality product but also supports sustainable and ethical farming practices.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Organic cocoa powder offers more than just a rich flavour; it's a nutrient-rich ingredient that can enhance both the taste and health benefits of various dishes. Its versatility in culinary applications, combined with the benefits of ethical sourcing, makes it an essential component of a health-conscious and environmentally aware kitchen.</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/cocoa/\" target=\"_new\">Harvard T.H.

    "description": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is Guar Gum?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Many people consume it, but few are aware precisely what is Guar Gum. Originating from the dry regions of Asia and Africa, guar gum is made from legumes known as guar beans. It is a polysaccharide, made up of the sugars mannose and galactose. Most people encounter it as a food additive that is found in many popular processed foods, most notably ice cream, yoghurts, salad dressings and sauces. Its major advantage as a food additive lies in its ability to provide stability and thickness to food and snacks. Guar gum is high in soluble fiber while low in calories.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Where does guar gum come from?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Guar beans are principally grown in India where between 2.3 and 3 million tons of beans are produced annually. This represents about 80% of the world&rsquo;s guar bean production.&nbsp; Other commercial levels of guar bean production occur in Pakistan, Africa, Australia and the USA.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is guar gum used for?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Guar gum is often used in keto recipes and serves several practical purposes including&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Use as an emulsifier or stabiliser, a small amount can help to prevent ingredients from separating or &ldquo;settling.&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Acting as a thickening agent instead of common starches or flours. Guar Gum actually has nearly eight times the thickening capacity as cornstarch.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Can help to bind ingredients together and is particularly useful when preparing low carb batters or doughs.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Can be used to add texture to a recipe.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>The benefits of guar gum</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Several studies have provided indications that guar gum can be beneficial to the health of those who consume it. These potential health benefits are:</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It may aid digestion and relieve constipation &ndash; </span><span>Due to its high fiber content, guar gum may provide relief to those experiencing constipation by enhancing movement within the intestinal tract. Furthermore, as a prebiotic it can encourage the growth of good bacteria and have a positive impact on the reduction of harmful bacteria within the stomach.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It can lower cholesterol &ndash; </span><span>Prior research conducted in the 1990s found that people with type 2 diabetes that were given guar gum three times a day experienced a reduction in cholesterol levels by up to 7 per cent. The reason is because fiber attacks bile acids that are present in the body causing them to be expelled from the body. The liver then uses up cholesterol to produce more bile acids therefore decreasing a person&rsquo;s overall cholesterol levels.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It can lower blood sugar levels &ndash; </span><span>Because it contains a high amount of soluble fiber, guar gum can slow the absorption of sugar and lower blood sugar levels.

While nuts are often considered one of the healthier snack options available, the presence of phytic acid minimizes the potential nutritional benefits that this product can provide. Phytic acid binds itself to nutrients thus reducing the consumer&rsquo;s ability to obtain maximum nutritional benefit. Activated nuts overcome this problem.</p>\r\n<h2>What are activated nuts?</h2>\r\n<p>Many wonder what are activated nuts? To maximise nutritional benefit, nuts are often activated. The process of activation involves soaking the product in water and salt for a 7 to 12-hour period. The product is then dehydrated at a low temperature for an additional 12 to 24 hours prior to consumption. Activation removes the toxins that are often present that inhibits proper digestion and nutrient absorption.</p>\r\n<h2>Are activated nuts better for you?</h2>\r\n<p>In a word, yes. Activated nuts are not only ideal because they have removed phytic acid and inhibitors, but they are also wonderful because they contain more nutrients than would otherwise be the case. This means that the levels of protein and vitamins found in activated nuts are much higher than those which have not been activated. This, in addition, to being easier to digest, makes them a wonderful healthy snack option for people of all ages.</p>\r\n<h2>What type of nuts can be activated?</h2>\r\n<p>All nuts can be activated and all benefit from the process. This means if you are a fan of cashews, pistachios, almonds, hazelnuts or any other type of nut you can find an activated version. In addition, many forms of grains and seeds are also activated to maximise the nutritional benefit of these products including buckwheat, muesli and quinoa.</p>\r\n<h2>Activated nuts Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> you can purchase many types of activated nuts that have been sourced from trusted brands from Australia and around the world.

While many are keen to adopt the practice of not eating animal products, one of the biggest frustrations for vegans is the need to give up on cheese. People&rsquo;s love of cheese stems from the delicious flavour it provides when added to a versatile range of products. From sandwiches, to baked dishes to pizzas, and so much more, cheese is a welcome addition to an abundance of foods that we consume daily. But for the vegan, this is one great sacrifice that comes with cutting out dairy products. But not anymore, with the ability for vegans to create their own vegan parmesan cheese out of non-animal products.</p>\r\n<h2>What exactly is vegan parmesan cheese?</h2>\r\n<p>Put simply vegan parmesan cheese is cheese made that is free of any animal ingredients. It can be made using a range of different ingredients including: soy protein, nutritional yeast, solidified vegetable oil, hemp and/or a range of nuts (almonds and cashews most commonly). The taste can be quite different but still delicious. The reason the taste differs is largely due to the way that the proteins in actual cheese infuse with each other. Because vegan parmesan cheese does not experience this effect, the same complex flavours found in actual cheese are often missing. This does not mean that the taste in itself isn&rsquo;t flavoursome though, and many consumers report liking vegan cheese just as much, once they get used to the difference in flavour.</p>\r\n<h2>Vegan parmesan cheese Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> there are a range of vegan parmesan cheese products that have been sourced from the most trusted brands from Australia and around the globe. Vegans no longer need to miss out on adding cheese to their meals any longer.

    "description": "<h2>What is vegan bacon?</h2>\r\n<p>Did you say vegan bacon!? For many, one of the most frustrating things about a vegan lifestyle is missing out on the delicious foods that many people rave about daily. One such food is bacon. Delicious in taste and adored by millions around Australia, the taste sensation of bacon is one that vegans unfortunately never get to enjoy. Until now. Vegan bacon has taken the world by storm and is made using a wide variety of bases. The most well-known bases include tofu, chickpeas, coconut, eggplant, almonds and tempeh. The base is then soaked in a delicious marinade to create that distinctive smoky flavor. The marinade normally contains a salty vegan ingredient such as liquid aminos and a sweet vegan ingredient, such as agave or brown sugar.</p>\r\n<h2>Why is vegan bacon so good?</h2>\r\n<p>Not only do you get the delicious taste of traditional bacon, but you also receive several additional benefits by choosing a vegan alternative. These benefits include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>You&rsquo;ll avoid excess consumption of processed red meat. </strong>The World Health Organization has released information linking the consumption of processed, red meat with certain types of cancer. This means traditional bacon lovers need be aware of the dangers of excess-consumption. By starting the day with a vegan bacon alternative such dangers can be avoided.</li>\r\n<li><strong>It has greater nutritional benefits. </strong>Vegan bacon is high in protein and fibre while being low in fat and with zero cholesterol. Although it can vary, generally three slices of vegan bacon will only contain 100 calories giving you a satisfying start to the day without adding an extra bulge to the waistline.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Vegan Bacon Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> you can find vegan bacon Australia products that have been supplied by only the most trusted local and international brands in the industry.

Normally not vegan due to the presence of eggs, health food manufacturers are now placing a focus into providing an egg-free mayonnaise option for the ever-expanding vegan population. This shift in focus is largely due to the growing acceptance of a vegan lifestyle in modern society.

The benefits of such a diet include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>You&rsquo;ll likely consume more nutrients. </strong>Switching away from animal and meat products will lead to you looking elsewhere for your daily food intake. This likely leads to higher consumption of natural foods that have great nutritional value such as grains, fruits, vegetables and nuts. In addition, using <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/condiments-and-spreads/\">condiments and spreads</a> such as vegan mayonnaise instead of the regular kind will lead to less fat consumption and a greater nutritional intake.</li>\r\n<li><strong>It&rsquo;ll improve your waistline.</strong> Non-animal product options such as vegan mayonnaise contain far less fat and more protein than their non-vegan alternatives.

The good news is that the market has been overrun with healthy food alternatives that now make it possible not to have to ditch these food products that you love so much.</p>\r\n<h2>What are high protein muffins?</h2>\r\n<p>Historically, muffins are made with refined flours and sugars that make them high in carbohydrates and devoid of nutritional benefit. However, now you can purchase high protein muffins that are packed full of protein and the essential nutrients required for a healthier lifestyle. This is partly achieved by substituting white flour with whole wheat flour. By using whole wheat flours, a tremendous amount of fibre is present which provides the body with satisfaction and a stabilization in blood sugar levels. In addition, a substantially high level of protein is also present which aids in muscle growth, recovery and repair.</p>\r\n<h2>Low in carbohydrates</h2>\r\n<p>Because of the use of a whole wheat flour, these muffin mix packages are tremendously beneficial in relation to the low level of carbohydrates that they possess. Low carb protein muffins are essentially the answer to snacking on something that is a nutrient rich, healthy snack but lacks flavour and psychological satisfaction. These healthy protein muffins are not only great for the mind, and great to satisfy a craving but will deliver major benefits in the way of protein and fibre.</p>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> you can purchase delicious high protein muffins at outstanding value that will boost muscle recovery without doing damage to your waistline.

Most commonly, they are used in tablet form to provide health benefits such as reducing blood pressure and alleviating the symptoms of asthma. They can also be added to cooking dishes as a spice in seed form to add flavour. Additionally, black seed oil can be applied to the skin for beauty purposes such as eliminating acne and the softening of skin.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\r\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\"><strong>What are the health benefits of Black seed oil?</strong></h2>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">For many, the biggest appeal of&nbsp;black seed benefits are the health related in that it provides to those who consume it regularly. The black seed oil benefits include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">It can reduce hypertension[1]&nbsp;&ndash; Taking black cumin seed oil products for a few months has been shown to reduce high blood pressure. N. sativa is known&nbsp;to have demonstrable antioxidant, hypotensive, diuretic and calcium channel blockading properties that make it effective in helping to reduce blood pressure, Clinical trials have shown kalonji or black seed oil to be most effective in helping to reduce blood pressure levels for people exhibiting moderate levels of high blood pressure.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Contains powerful antioxidants including thymoquinone&nbsp;[2]and t-anethol.&nbsp;Antioxidants are known to prevent cellular damage from free radicals and oxidants. Research suggests that antioxidants can guard the body against chronic diseases associated with oxidative stress including diabetes and heart disease.&nbsp;The antioxidant thymoquinone in particular has been shown to have powerful anti inflammatory and other health properties. Many nutritionists and biologists see thymoquinone as one of the most powerful antioxidants available. It is considered to be the most beneficial property produced by the nigella sativa plant. Thymoquinone has also been shown to alter molecular and signalling pathways in degenerative diseases.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">It has been shown to assist in aiding weight loss[3]. Clinical trial studies have&nbsp;shown that black seed supplements may assist in reducing a person's overall BMI (Body Mass Index) Furthermore, the journal of diabetes and metabolic disorders has found that black seed oil can have a role to play in tackling obesity.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">May help to fight bacteria. Studies have been very promising in this area[4]. One clinical trial showed that black seed oil was effective when&nbsp;applied topically to children suffering staphylococcal infections of the skin. Further studies have shown that Kalonji is effective in fighting MRSA - a bacteria that is resistant to many antibiotics. Further studies need to be conducted in this area , but the initial indicators are that the use of black seed in traditional medicine was justified.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">It can help maintain healthy cholesterol[5]. Cholesterol is a necessary fat like substance in the body, however too much cholesterol can cause cardiac problems. Clinical trials have shown black seed to be effective in both increasing the good HDL cholesterol while causing a significant reduction in the level of bad ldl cholesterol. Interestingly, black seed or kalonji oil was shown to be more effective in reducing bad levels than the seed itself while the seed helped increase good levels.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">It is beneficial for asthmatics[6]&nbsp;&ndash; The anti-inflammatory properties contained within can reduce inflammation in the airways which is a significant advantage for those suffering from asthma.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">May help regulate blood sugar levels[7]. A clinical trial&nbsp;has shown that black seed&nbsp;taken over a period of three months greatly reduced average&nbsp;blood sugar, fasting blood sugar and insulin resistance. In 2016 the British Journal of Pharmaceutical research indicated that nigella sativa oil was substantially important in treating diabetes as it enhanced insulin production as well as glucose tolerance.&nbsp;The journal also noted that nigella sativa oil seemed to be responsible for a proliferation of beta cells.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">N. sativa seed oil may also assist in treating diabetes patients with&nbsp;complications such as neuropathy[8], atherosclerosis and nephropathy</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">A 2013 clinical study[9]&nbsp;showed that diabetic rats when treated with a high dosage of n. sativa oil gained therapeutic effects from the the treatment</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">There is also some scientific evidence to show that n. sativa oil may be helpful in treating liver and kidney disease[10]</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Can reduce inflammation. Inflammation is a natural response to injury or infection, however persistent inflammation can lead to degenerative diseases such as heart disease&nbsp;and&nbsp;diabetes. Indications are that black seed can help fight inflammation. One clinical study showed that a small sample of test subjects suffering rheumatoid arthritis taking just 1000mg of oil per day showed noticeable improvement after a period of eight weeks. Clinical trials on rats have shown promising results in this area, however further studies are required on human subjects to find exactly how and why black seed is anti-inflammatory.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">It can ease an upset stomach &ndash; Taking the product regularly can help to reduce bloating, gas and ulcers therefore relieving stomach cramps and associated pain. Research in relation to stomach ulcer treatment at this stage has been limited to animal clinical trials, however, the&nbsp;results have been fairly promising.</span></li>\r\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 10px;\"><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">May protect you from liver damage.

Packed with anti-inflammatory compounds and allantoin, it's no wonder comfrey cream finds favor amongst individuals seeking relief from aches and pains.</p>\n<h2 data-sourcepos=\"7:1-7:35\"><strong>When to Consider Comfrey Cream:</strong></h2>\n<ul data-sourcepos=\"9:1-13:0\">\n<li data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:159\"><strong>Bruises and bumps:</strong>&nbsp;Whether you've tripped over the curb or bumped into a doorway, comfrey cream can help tame swelling and ease discomfort (reference 1).</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"10:1-10:152\"><strong>Sprains and strains:</strong>&nbsp;From a twisted ankle to a pulled muscle, comfrey cream can offer gentle relief and support the healing process (reference 2).</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"11:1-11:178\"><strong>Wounds and gout:</strong>&nbsp;While not a substitute for proper medical care, comfrey cream may help wounds heal faster and soothe the pain associated with gout flare-ups (reference 3).</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"12:1-13:0\"><strong>Back pain and osteoarthritis:</strong>&nbsp;Research suggests comfrey cream can be surprisingly effective in easing the discomfort of back pain and osteoarthritis (references 4, 5).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 data-sourcepos=\"14:1-14:24\"><strong>A Legacy of Healing:</strong></h2>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"16:1-16:315\">The soothing properties of comfrey have been lauded in traditional medicine for over 200 years. Even today, its analgesic and anti-inflammatory qualities are recognized, making it a valuable addition to many natural medicine cabinets. However, approaching this powerful remedy with caution and awareness is crucial.</p>\n<h2 data-sourcepos=\"18:1-18:22\"><strong>A Word of Caution:</strong></h2>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"20:1-20:566\">Though natural, comfrey cream isn't without its potential downsides. Due to its alkaloid content, it should <strong>never be ingested</strong> and kept strictly out of reach of children. Even topical application allows for some alkaloid absorption, so always use small amounts for short periods (no longer than 2-3 weeks, reference 6). Consulting your doctor before using comfrey cream is paramount, especially if you have any existing health conditions like liver or kidney disease, are pregnant or breastfeeding, or take medications that may interact with it (references 7, 8).</p>\n<h2 data-sourcepos=\"22:1-22:36\"><strong>Unlocking the Healing Potential:</strong></h2>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"24:1-24:315\">Used wisely, comfrey cream can offer a range of benefits, especially for wound healing. Studies have shown its effectiveness in treating arthritis, back pain, and ankle sprains. However, it's important to remember that research is still ongoing, and its efficacy for other conditions requires further investigation.</p>\n<h2 data-sourcepos=\"26:1-26:36\"><strong>Finding the Right Comfrey Cream:</strong></h2>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"28:1-28:271\">At Buy Organics Online, we understand the importance of quality and safety.

Otherwise known as pumpkin seeds, they are a tremendous source of essential nutrients and possess the added benefit of tasting delicious. Popular in Mexican cuisine, they are incredibly versatile in how they can be prepared and are a welcome addition to a wide variation of dishes.

Dice/shred remaining avocado and add to coleslaw which is now ready for serving.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>When the burger mix is cooked, halve buns, top with lettuce and add mix to each bun.

So, what is jackfruit and where does it come from? For starters, it is the largest fruit tree in the world.. It is extremely nutritious and can be used in a long list of meat alternative food products. The plant is a member of the breadfruit family and the fruit itself is quite large growing up to three feet in length and weighing up to 100 pounds. The oblong green fruit has a fleshy exterior. When cut open the inside of the fruit reveals many edible&nbsp;yellow bulbs all joined at the core of the fruit. The seeds of the plant are also edible.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Jackfruit trees are amazingly productive. One plant can produce over 200 fruit in a single year.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">The jackfruit tree is found in many Asian countries across Southeast Asia, particularly and is the national fruit of Bangladesh. The fruit is now grown commercially in parts of Australia and the United States such as South Florida&nbsp;where a tropical climate exists.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\r\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\">What does jackfruit taste like?</h2>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Because it is a tropical fruit many are unfamiliar with, many ask what does jackfruit taste like? Well, the most common description is that jackfruit is very similar in taste to pulled pork. Others have described a taste like pear,&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333; text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/pineapple-juice/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">pineapple</a></span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;\">, banana and papaya. Young jackfruit is not as sweet and its flavour has a more neutral quality. The unripe jackfruit is often canned and advertised as green jackfruit highlighting its relative lack of sweetness.

Well as mentioned above there are numerous ways. It can be eaten raw and fresh, added as an ingredient into wintery soups. It is also a common ingredient in chips, ice creams, jams and juices. But most commonly people add it to a sandwich due to the delicious pulled pork taste that it can provide for the vegan and vegetarian.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\r\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\">Does jackfruit taste like meat?</h2>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">As we&rsquo;ve already mentioned, Jack fruit has a taste that has been likened to pulled pork.

    "description": "<h2>What is extra virgin olive oil</h2>\r\n<p>Have you ever wondered what is extra virgin olive oil? Well, basically olive oil comes in two forms: unrefined and refined. The difference between olive oil and extra virgin olive oil is simple. The refined (olive oil) variety is altered to remove small flaws that make it more attractive to buyers, whereas the unrefined (extra virgin) variety is oil in its purest form. While refined oils lose the important antioxidants and anti-inflammatories, unrefined oils maintain these important properties. This makes extra virgin olive oil a much healthier option for consumers.</p>\r\n<h2>Extra virgin olive oil benefits</h2>\r\n<p>As such, there are some important advantages that a consumer can derive from consuming olive oil in its purest form. The extra virgin olive oil benefits include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>It can protect against diabetes. </strong>Extra virgin olive oil can help to regulate and balance insulin levels therefore providing great benefits to those at risk of developing diabetes.</li>\r\n<li><strong>It can protect against cognitive decline. </strong>Because this product is high in monosaturated fats it can slow down cognitive decline that is associated with diseases such as dementia and Alzheimer&rsquo;s.</li>\r\n<li><strong>It boosts your immune system.</strong> This product contains a rich number of antioxidants that are essential for the protection of your immune system and can help stave off infections.</li>\r\n<li><strong>It can relieve pain.</strong> This product contains oleocanthal, which has anti-inflammatory properties and acts much like ibuprofen. Because inflammation can result in several diseases, anti-inflammatory agents such as oleocanthal can tremendously reduce the risk of such diseases while also reducing pain experienced in day to day life.</li>\r\n<li><strong>It can provide positive skin benefits. </strong>Extra virgin olive oil adds a protective coating to the skin when applied naturally or consumed, this has been shown to improve skin damage and provide anti-aging benefits.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Extra virgin olive oil Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At Buy Organics online there is a range of <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/olive-oil/\">olive</a> oil products that are available for purchase.

    "description": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>White and Brown Rice Flour</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Available in both white and brown rice flour forms, this sensational flour product is ideal for those looking to avoid wheat and gluten. It is made from milled rice and has long been a staple food for those in Japan, Southeast Asia and parts of Southern India. It is an extremely popular ingredient in soups and pasta sauces because of its ability to prevent liquid from separating. It also provides some handy health benefits for those who choose to consume it.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is rice flour?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rice flour is made much like other flours by grinding the rice grain down into a powder. Exactly how the flour is made will determine how healthy it is.</span><span><br /></span><span>The grain has three distinct components, the bran, germ and endosperm. Rice flour is made by separating these three components and grinding them. How much of each component is included in the final product determines how it is classified. Whole grain rice flour contains all three components of the rice kernel. Whole flours have&nbsp; reduced levels of bran and germ, while white rice flours generally only contains the endosperm.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is rice flour used for?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rice flour is generally used for baking and acts as a worthy substitute for wheat based flours. It is worth remembering that rice flour will need to be used in combination with other gluten free flours and starches to achieve a similar effect to all purpose flour. Most gluten free recipes that recommend rice flour will provide the right ratio of complementary&nbsp; ingredients to achieve the desired effect.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How much rice flour to replace wheat flour?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The answer to this question will depend upon how you intend to use the flour. If you are using rice flour as a thickening agent in soup or gravy, you can safely use very similar amounts. However, when baking the answer is not so straightforward and may require some experimentation unless working with a recipe that specifically states the use of rice flour. Generally to substitute rice flour for all purpose flour you will need a mixture of rice flour, potato starch, tapioca flour and xanthan gum.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>The health benefits of rice flour</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>There are some great health benefits that come with the consumption of rice flour on a semi-regular basis. These benefits include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It is a great gluten-free choice. </span><span>Because rice flour is made using a gluten-free grain, it is a solid choice for those who have gluten intolerances or suffer from celiac disease. Gluten is most commonly found in grain products, such as wheat. These wheat products are often used in many dishes and this is less than ideal for those with intolerances. This can result in severe digestive problems. Rice flour offers the perfect alternative for these people.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It can lower cholesterol and maintain blood sugar levels.</span><span> Rice flour contains an impressive amount of insoluble fibre. This type of fibre may help lower cholesterol and maintain blood sugar levels making it an ideal product for those at risk of heart disease and at risk of developing type-2 diabetes.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It may help improve liver functioning.</span><span> Rice flour contains choline and this is an important macronutrient that can help the body to remove triglycerides and cholesterol from out of the liver to other parts of the body. This in turn leads to the individual maintaining a healthier liver than would otherwise be the case.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What to cook with rice flour</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Cooking with rice flour offers many possibilities and a gluten free way of cooking. A quick perusal of a gluten free cookbook will give you numerous ideas. Some popular recipes include banana brownies, gluten free muffins, shortbread biscuits and gluten free batters.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rice flour Australia</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>At </span><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/\"><span>Buy Organics Online</span></a><span> there are many healthy flour products available for purchase.

    "description": "<h2>Spelt Flour</h2>\r\n<p>Spelt Flour is a cereal grain that belongs to the wheat family, but interestingly, is not wheat at all. While it has the same genus as wheat, it originates from a different species altogether. It is an ancient grain that has been used for centuries but fell out of favour in the 19<sup>th</sup> century. It has made a comeback in recent times, largely due to the need for people to find alternatives to wheat due to intolerances.</p>\r\n<h2>Is Spelt Flour gluten-free?</h2>\r\n<p>Here is where people can get a little confused. Many ask if it is a wheat alternative, does this mean that spelt flour is gluten free? Well, no. While it is an effective alternative for those that suffer wheat intolerances, for those that suffer from celiac disease and other gluten allergies it needs to be avoided. You see, the gluten in traditional wheat products are made up of equal parts glutenin and gliadin. Glutenin provides elasticity, while gliadin provides stretchiness. With spelt flour there is a higher amount of gliadin as opposed to glutenin. This means that while it does contain gluten, it contains less than wheat and is therefore a good option for those looking to cut down on their gluten consumption. But again, it needs to be avoided by those that suffer from celiac disease and gluten allergies.</p>\r\n<h2>Spelt flour Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> you can access a range of spelt flour products that have been sourced from the most trusted brands from Australia and around the world.

The plant that sorghum flour is extracted from is a member of the plant family known as <em>Panicoideae. </em>It is considered a versatile food source but is most commonly grown in commercial quantities for use as a gluten-free flour alternative. Either beige or white in colour, sorghum flour is considered mild-tasting and sweet in flavour.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>The benefits of sorghum flour</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>If you have been wondering what are the health benefits of sorghum, there are some tremendous health benefits that come with using sorghum flour. These benefits include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It is a gluten-free flour alternative. </span><span>It is an excellent substitute for wheat flour and the ideal baking ingredient for those who cannot tolerate gluten such as those with celiac disease.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It contains no genetically modified ingredients.</span><span> Foods that contain genetically modified ingredients, such as wheat flour, have been linked to learning disabilities, digestive issues and inflammation.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It is high in fibre.</span><span> Because of this, sorghum flour is great for overall digestive and cardiovascular health.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It is a solid source of antioxidants.</span><span> Where foods have a high source of antioxidants there can be tremendous benefits in relating to reducing the risks of diabetes, heart disease and some neurological diseases.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Sorghum has high nutritional value and is a wonderful source of vitamins, minerals and protein as well as being rich in fiber.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It can help provide balance to blood sugar levels. </span><span>Sorghum flour is low in GI which means that it slows the level of which sugar is absorbed into the blood stream. This is extremely helpful for anyone who suffers from diabetes.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>So, is sorghum flour safe for celiacs.</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Sorghum flour is gluten free and therefore should be safe for celiacs. However, it is important to check the labelling on sorghum products to ensure that the labelling states that the flour is gluten free. If this label is not present, it may indicate that some cross contamination has occurred either in the harvesting or packaging process.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Can I use sorghum flour instead of flour</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Sorghum flour makes an excellent baking substitute for flour, there are, however, several things to keep in mind when using sorghum flour instead of traditional flours. As sorghum is gluten free, you will need to use a binding agent when baking with it. Binding agents that work include&nbsp; egg whites, xanthan gum, gelatin or cornstarch. Alternately you can mix sorghum flour with sa starch flour such as arrowroot or sweet rice flour to attain similar results.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>As a broad rule of thumb you can substitute sorghum flour for flour on a cup or cup basis. When adding binder to sorghum, half a teaspoon per cup will suffice for sweet recipes, while a full teaspoon per cup will be required for savoury and bread baking.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Is Sorghum flour high in carbs?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Sorghum flour is not considered to be a low carb flour, however, it isn&rsquo;t at the high ed of the scale either. A quarter cup of sorghum flour contains approximately twenty five grams of carbohydrates.</span></p>\r\n<h2>Sorghum Flour Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> there are a range of sorghum flour Australia products that have been sourced from only the most trusted brands.

Though other grains such as wheat, oats and barley are more common in the shops, rye is worth looking for and introducing in your daily diet.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Organic whole grain rye flour is made from grain grown without the use of artificial chemicals, pesticides or gmo organisms.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rye Flour Health Benefits</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Although rye is not gluten free, it has many health benefits for the gluten tolerant ones. It has been found that rye is healthier than the mainstream&nbsp; barley and wheat products due to the nature of the seed. In other words, the rye seed holds nutrients and fiber that are not omitted while producing the rye flour. This makes the flour even healthier since nutrients are being transferred in the final product.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Now, let&rsquo;s look at some of the health benefits that rye flour provides and why it is in such high demand.</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Weight loss and metabolism booster</span><span> &ndash; It has been identified how rye flour can not only balance your metabolism but also helps you lose weight. That&rsquo;s due to its ability to make you feel full much faster and reduce your appetite. This way it manages to reduce food and calorie intake.[1]</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Lowers Diabetes Risk</span><span> &ndash; Rye&rsquo;s ability to improve glucose levels and&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://draxe.com/nutrition/rye-flour/\"><span>insulin sensitivity</span></a><span> can lower the risk of diabetes.[2]</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Against cancer</span><span> &ndash; Rye&rsquo;s nutrients and fiber content can actually fight against the development of cancerous cells.[3]</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Inflammation</span><span> &ndash; Unlike wheat, rye can reduce inflammation as a result of reducing insulin sensitivity. Inflammation can also cause diabetes and so by reducing body inflammation results in lowering the chances of diabetes.[4]</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is Rye Flour used for?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rye flour can easily replace other common flours in baking. Using whole grain rye flour is even more beneficial for your heart health and weight loss. The dark rye &ndash; whole grain one &ndash; is less processed and less refined which results in nutrients to be kept intact and offer many more health benefits. Opt for the dark rye flour in as many recipes as you can for maximum health improvement results. Rye is a popular choice or whole grain bread .</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rye Bread</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rye bread is a popular whole grain bread alternative to wheat flour bread and other whole grain breads. Organic rye flour bread has a sharper taste and thicker texture than most other cereal grain breads. The bread can be made from a combination of bread flours or from rye flour alone. The varieties of rye bread are numerous with whole grain rye flour bread and sourdough bread recipes being popular. Sourdough bread is not the same as rye bread but can be made from rye grain flour using the same process used in all sourdough recipes. Sourdough is created by using a starter dough mixture of flour and water to attract&nbsp; yeast to leaven the bread. This dough may be left for several days.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rye bread in all its forms is becoming increasingly popular and is said to have the following benefits.</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Full of plant molecules known as phytoestrogens that help to balance hormone levels.[5]</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Appetite suppressant. Research has found that whole rye bread sandwiches are more likely to keep people satisfied than sandwiches made with&nbsp; bread made from whole wheat flour or white flour [6]</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Controls blood sugar levels more effectively as it is low in the glycaemic index [7]</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rye whole grain Contributes to heart health, being a good source of magnesium and soluble fibre. Magnesium helps to control blood pressure, while soluble fibre contributes to lowering cholesterol levels.[8]</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Plus all the regular benefits of rye whole grain.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Beside making great bread a good rye flour&nbsp; can also be used as a traditional flour substitute in homemade pasta and a variety of pastries and baked treats. It is important to recognise that while the flour does contain some gluten it contains much less than other bread flour. Accordingly, many recipes advocate for a mixture of flours to achieve a lightness in the bread. Many bakers suggest a mixture of 25% rye to 75% traditional flour to achieve a balance between texture and the flavour of rye dough.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rye berries are often added to rye bread to give some added texture and flavour. rye berries are simply the whole grain form of rye with the hull removed.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rye Flour Australia</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Purchase your organic rye flour from Australian suppliers and brands as well as international ones, at Buy Organics Online.

    "description": "<h2>What is Rapadura Sugar?</h2>\r\n<p>Many people have asked what is rapadura sugar and why should I use it over traditional sugar products? Put simply, it is an unrefined form of cane sugar that has a fine texture and can be used anywhere that you&rsquo;d normally use white sugar. It possesses a rich caramel taste and contains more nutrients than traditional white sugar.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rapadura sugar is produced in Brazil using a totally natural and organic process. Depending on where it is produced, it also can be called Panella, Raspadura, Chancaca and Piloncilla. Because of the way it is produced it can vary slightly in colour.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2>The benefits of Organic Rapadura Sugar</h2>\r\n<p>There are some tremendous health benefits that comes with consuming organic rapadura sugar in place of traditional white sugar. These benefits include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>It has a low glycemic index. </strong>Because this product possesses a low GI, it is an ideal alternative to white sugar for those looking to slow the release of energy into the body. This results in the stabilization of blood sugar levels which can be extremely beneficial for those who suffer from diabetes.</li>\r\n<li><strong>It is high in vitamins and minerals. </strong>Rapadura sugar isn&rsquo;t as processed as the alternatives. This means that it retains many essential minerals including potassium, calcium and magnesium. In addition, it is higher in Niacin, Vitamin A, B1, B2 and B6 which illustrates its value over the alternatives.</li>\r\n<li><strong>It is higher in iron than traditional white sugar. </strong>The standard 1 teaspoon serving of rapadura sugar contains 10% of your daily iron requirements. Iron is essential in the human body as it helps to produce the two proteins, hemoglobin and myoglobin. These proteins carry oxygen throughout the body which is crucial to healthy functioning.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Despite the benefits, it must be noted, that this is still a sugar product and as such should only be taken in moderation.</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Is rapadura sugar the same as brown sugar?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This is a commonly asked question. Rapadura sugar and brown sugar are not the same. Rapadura sugar has been organically produced by extracting the juice from the cane and then cooking at very high temperatures to crystallise it. The molasses is not separated from the sugar at any time. Brown sugar on the&nbsp; other hand is simple refined sugar with molasses added back to it.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is a substitute for rapadura sugar?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>If you do not have any rapadura sugar available and are looking for a substitute, the best alternatives would be muscovado or demerara sugar. Both of these sugars also undergo minimal processing.</span></p>\r\n<h2>Organic Rapadura Sugar Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> you can get a wide range of rapadura sugar Australia products that have been sourced from only the most trusted manufacturers. A healthier alternative to traditional <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/organic-sugar/\">sugar</a> products, consider adding rapadura to your kitchen pantry today!</p>",

    "description": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>What Is Organic Turmeric Powder Australia?</strong></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Part of the ginger family, turmeric (curcuma longa) is a staple cooking ingredient in Southeast Asian cooking.&nbsp; The powder is derived from the turmeric root (rhizome) of the plant. Organic turmeric powder is powder that has been derived from a plant that has not been subjected to pesticides or chemicals of any kind.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Turmeric is widely used in Asian cooking and is the spice that gives curry its yellow appearance. It is often used in marinades, curries, hot pots, and soups. It is also said to be a delicious additive to cold and hot beverages.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">In recent years, the Western world has caught on to the turmeric secret, and it is now recognised as a superfood with many health benefits. You can find organic turmeric powder right here in Australia, and it is 100% organic!</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Organic Turmeric Powder Benefits</strong></h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Not only have turmeric root powder and turmeric extracts long been used in Indian cuisine for their flavor, spice, and natural health benefits, but they have also been essential ingredients in Ayurvedic medicine. Science has now established that the purported benefits of Ayurveda and Indian cuisine are certainly provable when turmeric is an active ingredient.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One of the major ingredients in turmeric is curcumin, which is a powerful antioxidant with anti-inflammatory properties. However, as it is not easily absorbed into the bloodstream, it is recommended that a combination of turmeric and black pepper be taken. Black pepper&nbsp; contains piperine, which will act as an agent to enhance curcumin absorption by as much as 2,000 percent[1] If you are not fond of black pepper, there are turmeric supplements available. If you choose to take turmeric supplements, keep in mind that the best turmeric supplement will contain piperine. The benefits of taking pure organic turmeric powder or turmeric supplements are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The antioxidants and chemical makeup of curcumin make it a great aid in fighting inflammation at a molecular level. Chronic inflammation is thought to be the underlying cause of most degenerative western diseases, and natural supplements that can combat inflammation without the side effects of pharmaceuticals can be valuable in this fight. Organic turmeric, with all of its nutritional value, has that capacity.[2]</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It substantially increases the body&rsquo;s antioxidant capacity by stimulating antioxidant enzymes within the body [3] as well as delivering a fresh supply of antioxidants.to boost the immune system.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Boosts brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which could help in increasing memory and logical thought patterns [4]. Additionally, most degenerative brain disorders, like Alzheimer's disease, have been linked to a lack of BDNF [5]</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Improves endothelial function (blood vessel lining), which could help reduce the risk of heart disease. Poor endothelial function has long been known to be a major contributor to heart disease and cardiovascular issues. The endelothium helps to regulate blood pressure and blood clotting. Studies have shown that curciminoids can help improve endelothium function.[6]</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Anti-inflammatory properties may relieve arthritis. Studies&nbsp; have demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory properties may be more effective than a drug designed for the purpose [7]</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">May have antidepressant properties as it boosts BDNF function and may help stimulate serotonin and dopamine production [8].</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Increased life expectancy, given all of the above factors</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">There is also evidence to suggest that when applied to the skin, turmeric can reduce dark circles, control acne, and provide some protection against sun damage.

As a spice, it can be added to various dishes, including curries and salads.&nbsp; As a supplement, it can be taken in tablet or capsule form. It is recommended that you seek medical advice before beginning any supplement intake, as supplements can interact with existing medication.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><strong>How to make turmeric powder</strong></h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To make turmeric powder, you need to be able to source completely dry turmeric or fresh turmeric and undertake the drying process. Even dried turmeric needs to be dried further in the sun so that it becomes crisp. It is recommended that the turmeric be broken into small pieces first and then covered with a mesh to prevent contamination from dust particles.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The small pieces should be left in the sun to completely dry. Unless it is completely dry, the turmeric will not grind into powder. Grind the powder immediately after drying while it is still warm from the sun.<br /><br />To grind the turmeric pieces, use a spice or coffee mill, then sieve it and repeat with the leftovers until you have a consistently smooth powder.

They are made simply from rolling quinoa into an extremely thin flake. This flatness makes them very comparable to rolled oats in texture and they can be substituted for rolled oats in many recipes and can be added to brownie recipes to add extra texture. The taste of quinoa flakes is quite mild making them quite a versatile ingredient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Their most common uses are as part of a warm breakfast, or as part of a savoury lunch or dinner.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is the difference between quinoa and quinoa flakes</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Quinoa is the whole seed while flakes have been flattened using a machine called a flaker.

    "description": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What is durum wheat?</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Have you ever wondered exactly what is durum wheat? Simply put, it is a type of whole wheat that has a higher protein content and more gluten than the more common forms of wheat. Durum wheat is much more nutrient-dense than its refined wheat cousins because it contains germ and bran that normally gets stripped away during the refining process. Durum wheat is used to make semolina flour which is favoured by many pasta makers. While derived from durum, semolina is not the same as durum wheat.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is durum wheat used for?&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Besides being used to make semolina, durum wheat is a popular choice when making couscous and bulgur. Couscous is made by mixing semolina with water to form a paste. Bulgur is made from boiling the grains of durum wheat. Semolina (a product of durum wheat) is a popular choice for pasta makers.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Besides these uses, the wheat can also be used for baking certain varieties of bread and has been extensively used for bread making in areas such as North Africa, Italy and the Middle East. As such it is seen as a good choice for homemade, artisan and flatbreads. It will, however, differ in texture and colour to traditional pan style breads.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Why is durum wheat used in pasta?</span><span><br /></span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Durum wheat is used to make semolina - a flour that is both high in protein and gluten. The texture of the flour makes it particularly suitable for pasta and noodle making.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Due to the high protein content, durum is a popular choice when making pasta as it is more nutrient rich than regular pasta choices.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>When looking for a durum wheat pasta product, make sure to look for an organic option where possible as this is the healthiest choice out there.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Benefits of durum wheat</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>There are several benefits that come from regular consumption of durum wheat. These benefits include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It is a great choice to boost B-vitamin intake. Folate and Thiamine that are present in this product are essential for healthy skin, hair and eyes.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It is a good source of selenium and iron. These essential minerals are crucial for healthy functioning. Selenium helps the body to prevent oxidation damage to our cells while iron serves to help assist oxygen to travel from the lungs to other areas of the body.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It can assist in weight loss. Because durum flour products are digested slower than alternatives it will leave you feeling fuller for longer which will help prevent you from feeling the urge to snack on unhealthy items throughout the day.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It has a low glycemic index.

    "description": "<h2>Agave Syrup</h2>\r\n<p>Produced in large quantity in Mexico, agave syrup is cultivated from the tequila plant. It is most commonly used as a sugar substitute and possesses a very sweet flavour. While agave is a little but higher in calories compared to sugar, it possesses a lower glycemic index and is therefore potentially beneficial to those who suffer from diabetes. Agave syrup contains a reasonable amount of iron and is calcium rich. Additionally, it is also a good source of zinc.</p>\r\n<h2>Organic Agave Syrup benefits</h2>\r\n<p>There are some great reasons why people may want to consider consuming organic agave syrup over traditional table sugar. These benefits are:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It is high in iron. As iron promotes the flow of oxygen from the lungs to other areas of the body, those who don&rsquo;t consume enough, can&rsquo;t make healthy oxygen-carrying blood cells.</li>\r\n<li>Agave syrup is a great source of zinc. Zinc is a mineral that is crucial in helping to heal wounds that a consumer may have suffered during their daily activities.</li>\r\n<li>It is high in calcium. This is a huge advantage over traditional sugar because calcium can help you to build and maintain strong bones. In addition, your heart and nerves also require calcium to perform at an optimum level.</li>\r\n<li>Saponins present in agave syrup can help reduce cholesterol levels that can provide positive health benefits by reducing the risk of heart disease.</li>\r\n<li>A good serving of this product can provide a healthy amount of fibre. Products that contain fibre can help to reduce the symptoms that cause constipation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Agave Syrup Australia</h2>\r\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> there are a range of organic agave syrup Australia products that have been sourced from only the most trusted manufacturers.

    "description": "<h2>What is Prune Juice?</h2>\r\n<p>Most of us have a grandparent who has advocated the benefits of prune juice but what exactly is it? Well simply put, a prune is a dried plum.&nbsp;The prune retains all the nutrients of plums which includes being a great energy source and not contributing to spikes in blood sugar levels.</p>\r\n<p>These dried plums are then crushed to fine particles and then dissolved in hot water. They are then strained which removes the skin, seeds and pits. The result is prune juice!</p>\r\n<h2>Prune juice benefits</h2>\r\n<p>There are several great benefits that can come with consumption of this products. The prune juice benefits include:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>It provides a laxative benefit that can relieve constipation. </strong>Perhaps the most well-known advantage of this product relates to its effectiveness in relieving constipation. Prune juice for constipation has been a well-known remedy since our grandparents and great grandparents were kids. This is due to the large fiber content in this product, most in the form of soluble fiber. The usefulness of soluble fiber is that it can help increase the size of your stool which triggers improved bowel movement.This increased movement is aided by the presence of sorbitol, a sugar that also acts as a laxative. The combination of soluble fiber and sorbitol is how prune juice can naturally treat constipation.</li>\r\n<li><strong>It is a great source of iron. </strong>Iron is important for the transmission of oxygen from the lungs to other areas of the body. This makes the product ideal for those at risk of anemia such as vegans and vegetarians who may be lacking in iron from other food sources.</li>\r\n<li><strong>It can prevent heart disease.</strong> Due to the high level of antioxidants in this product, LDL cholesterol levels can be reduced which can improve cardiovascular health and reduce the risk of heart disease.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How much prune juice for constipation?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The recommended amount of prune juice consumption will vary between children and adults. A healthy adult should consume between 120 and 250 millilitres of prune juice in the morning. If there have been no bowel movements for several days, three glasses of prune juice should be drunk over the course of the day.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>About 60 millilitres&nbsp;should be a sufficient dose for small children.</span><span><br /></span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How long does prune juice take to work</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Prune juice will affect people in different ways. It has been known to work as a laxative in a matter of minutes. For others it may take a little longer. It is generally recommended that you give prune juice several hours to have an effect on bowel movements before taking further actions to relieve the symptoms of constipation.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How to make prune juice</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Prune juice can be made reasonable easily if you can source enough prunes.

Noni juice, squeezed from the Morinda citrifolia, a Polynesian tree with sun-kissed leaves and secrets older than time, is a taste bud tango with a punch of \"hmm&hellip;\". Like a mango moonwalking in a parmesan factory, its bold bite and unique aroma might have you doing a double take. But beneath the surface, this tropical twister packs a vitamin-C-infused wallop that whispers promises of health and well-being.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"5:1-5:37\"><strong>A Fruit with Flair (and Foibles):</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"7:1-7:343\">Imagine a mango disguised as a rebel, cloaked in the aroma of a well-aged cheese. That's the noni fruit &ndash; bold, unapologetically bitter, and fiercely individual. Don't let its pungent personality scare you off; this Polynesian warrior is brimming with vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, all eager to unleash their health-boosting potential.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:40\"><strong>Charting the Noni Seas (with a Map):</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"11:1-11:368\">Studies paint a vibrant picture of noni's nutritional oasis, but like currents in the ocean, potency can vary across brands. To navigate this sea of choices, Buy Organics Online handpicks only the finest organic brands, ensuring every sip is a voyage of unadulterated goodness. Think of it as your personal Polynesian compass, guiding you towards the purest treasures.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"13:1-13:59\"><strong>Unleashing the Noni Spectrum (Without the Fear Factor):</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"15:1-15:356\">Pure noni juice is a taste bud expedition for the adventurous. But don't worry, landlubbers! You can blend it with your favourite tropical crew (think pineapple, mango, or even a whisper of honey), whip it into a vibrant smoothie, or add a touch of stevia for a sugar-free safari. Every drop is a chance to unlock a new flavour twist, no passport required.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"17:1-17:41\"><strong>A Word to the Wise (and the Curious):</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"19:1-19:280\">While generally safe for most, noni, like any explorer, requires a map and compass. Its high potassium content might not be the best friend for your kidneys, and it can sometimes clash with certain medications. So, a quick chat with your doctor before setting sail is always wise.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"21:1-21:38\"><strong>Embark on your Noni Journey Today:</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"23:1-23:425\">Buy Organics Online offers a curated selection of premium noni juice options, handpicked from trusted Polynesian shores.

The ancient Greeks and Romans revered it as a symbol of nature's abundance and a potent natural remedy. While much of its efficacy remains woven into tradition, modern research unveils intriguing possibilities for fennel, particularly in the form of a soothing tea.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:21\"><strong>Digestive Solace:</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"11:1-11:354\">For centuries, fennel tea has been a trusted companion for those seeking digestive comfort. Early reports highlight its potential to ease bloating, cramps, and gas. Studies exploring its use in managing irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) suggest some benefit, though further research is needed to clarify its long-term effectiveness (e.g., Kim et al., 2009).</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"13:1-13:47\"><strong>Weight Management Ally (Emerging Evidence):</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"15:1-15:379\">Preliminary research hints at fennel tea's possible role in weight management. Its diuretic properties may help combat water retention, and its potential metabolism modulation might offer a slight advantage (Chandrasekar et al., 2010). However, remember that fennel tea alone is not a weight-loss solution and should be part of a healthy lifestyle encompassing diet and exercise.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"17:1-17:35\"><strong>Other Intriguing Possibilities:</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"19:1-19:119\">While research continues to explore the full extent of fennel tea's potential, glimpses of hope exist in certain areas:</p>\n<ul data-sourcepos=\"21:1-24:0\">\n<li data-sourcepos=\"21:1-21:174\"><strong>Heartburn Relief:</strong>&nbsp;Anecdotal evidence suggests fennel tea might offer temporary relief from heartburn symptoms, but scientific studies are needed to validate this claim.</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"22:1-22:253\"><strong>Increased Milk Production:</strong>&nbsp;Animal studies indicate fennel may act as a galactagogue, potentially increasing milk production in lactating mothers (El Shabrawy et al., 2014). However, human trials are crucial to confirm its effectiveness and safety.</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"23:1-24:0\"><strong>Menstrual Support:</strong>&nbsp;Traditionally, fennel has been used to address menstrual irregularities. While research suggests its estrogenic properties may offer benefits, more robust studies are required to validate its effectiveness (Salehi et al., 2019).</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"25:1-25:26\"><strong>Safety Considerations:</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"27:1-27:253\">Fennel is generally considered safe for most individuals when consumed in moderation. However, those with specific medical conditions or taking certain medications should consult a healthcare professional before incorporating fennel tea into their diet.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"29:1-29:23\"><strong>Embrace the Ritual:</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"31:1-31:456\">While research continues to decipher the full spectrum of fennel tea's benefits, its rich history and potential contributions to well-being must be considered. Whether enjoyed solo or blended with other herbs, this fragrant brew offers a delightful way to embrace a time-honoured tradition and explore its potential health advantages. Remember, a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise remains the foundation for optimal well-being.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"31:1-31:456\">Find a comprehensive range of all our other great <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/organic-tea/\">organic tea</a> products at Buy Organics Online today!</p>",

Many consumers are advocates for perspirants and <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/deodorant/\">deodorant</a> products that contain aluminium, and this is less than ideal for health and vitality. This is because the application of aluminium has been linked to many serious health issues, including kidney issues, bone disorders, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, and even breast cancer. It is therefore essential to use a product that eliminates the likelihood of developing such health issues.</p>\n<h2>The best aluminium-free deodorant benefits</h2>\n<p>There are several great benefits that come from using aluminium free deodorant. The best benefits for applying these products include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It may lower the risk of developing Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease &ndash; </strong>Research has shown a strong correlation between Alzheimer&rsquo;s and high use of aluminum. Anything that a consumer can do to reduce the risk of developing such a horrible disease is highly advantageous.</li>\n<li><strong>It is better for breastfeeding mothers &ndash;</strong> As a mother, the breastfeeding process means that anything you are placing into or onto your body can be passed onto your child. This means that the dangerous toxins in aluminum present in natural deodorants would also be passed onto your baby.</li>\n<li><strong>It can remove the smell, not just mask it &ndash;</strong> While many anti-perspirants mask the smell over the course of the day, natural deodorants can prevent bacteria from forming which is often the cause of smelly odour.</li>\n<li><strong>It can improve overall skin health &ndash; </strong>The use of skincare products that contain dangerous chemicals can lead to dry and chaffed skin, and other damaged skin conditions. Switching to a natural product will avoid this.</li>\n<li><strong>It is cruelty free and vegan friendly &ndash; </strong>The beauty of such products means that, in almost all cases, they are not tested on animals and contain no animal byproducts.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Aluminum free deodorant Australia</h2>\n<p>At <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> there are a range of aluminium free Australia products that have been sourced from only the most trusted brands.

    "description": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is agar agar?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Agar agar is a plant based gelatin substitute that has been used in Asian recipes for centuries. As it is derived from the cell walls of varieties of red seaweed,it makes the perfect vegan alternative when recipes call for the use of gelatin. It can be substituted for gelatin on a 1:1 basis where gelatin is to be used as a thickening agent. Agar agar is tasteless and odorless and its use will not affect the overall taste or smell of any food prepared using it as a substitute for gelatin.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Is Gelatin and Agar Agar the same?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>While agar agar is often&nbsp; described as a gelatinous substance and it is used in much the same way as gelatin, it is not the same thing as gelatin. The key difference is that gelatin is obtained from the collagen obtained from animal bones or skin whereas agar agar is obtained from seaweed making it an excellent vegetarian or vegan substitute for gelatin. The only other substantive difference is that gelatin can be dissolved in warm liquid and will set as it cools, whereas agar agar must be brought to the boil&nbsp; before setting can take place.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Is agar agar healthy?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Agar agar has many healthy attributes.&nbsp; It is loaded with fibre, no fat, no sugar and no carbohydrates. It is also gluten free, preservative free and wheat free.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It assists in absorbing glucose in the stomach, passes quickly through the digestive system and helps to prevent the body from storing excess fat. These properties deliver substantial benefits which are listed below.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Benefits of using agar agar</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>As well as being vegan friendly, agar agar has some demonstrable health benefits that make its use an attractive proposition. These benefits include:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Being low in calories, fats, sugars and carbohydrates it has natural weight loss potential. It is also seen as something of an appetite suppressant.&nbsp; Agar agar is a key ingredient of a Japanese natural weight loss plan called the KAntan diet</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Being rich in soluble fibre it acts as a natural laxative and helps to transport toxins out of the body</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Has high concentrations of magnesium and calcium which contribute to better bone health</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Contains galactose, commonly referred to as brain sugar. This substance is known to contribute to the brain development of children</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>So, what can you do with agar agar?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Obviously agar agar works wonderfully well as a gelatin substitute and can be used in any recipe that calls for gelatin. A word of warning though, gelatin is much stronger than gelatin and one teaspoon is equivalent to about 8 teaspoons of gelatin - so factor that in to your recipes.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Aside from&nbsp; being a gelatin substitute, agar agar is used as a soup thickener, as an additive in fruit preserves and even in homemade ice cream recipes.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It can also be used for medicinal purposes as it is comprised of 80% fibre making it both an effective laxative and appetite suppressant.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Where can I get agar agar?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>You may be able to find agar agar in places such as Asian food stores, health food stores, some supermarkets that have health food sections and the occasional specialty food shop. However, to save you time and hassle, perhaps the best place to get Agar Agar is through the&nbsp; Buy Organics Online website.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Where to buy agar agar powder Australia can rely on</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you&rsquo;re looking for a reliable source of natural agar agar powder, there is no better place than the <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a> website.

Carbon chains are labelled according to number from C6 &ndash; through to C12. &nbsp;C6 and C8 oils are great for instant energy. C10 and C12 oils on the other hand are best for endurance and mental function.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>MCT Oils are largely tasteless &ndash; making it easy to incorporate them into your diet. &nbsp;It is important to note that MCT oil should not be used for cooking.

    "description": "<p>Maize flour, also commonly known as corn flour, is a staple ingredient in many cuisines worldwide. Its growing popularity in health-conscious circles is due to its rich nutritional profile and versatility in cooking. This article will delve into the benefits, uses, and nutritional aspects of maize flour, with a focus on organic maize flour, and will compare it to its alternatives.</p>\n<h3>What is Maize Flour?</h3>\n<p>Maize flour is a type of flour milled from dried maize (corn) kernels. It is a whole-grain flour, rich in fiber and antioxidants, and an excellent gluten-free option. Organic maize flour, derived from maize grown without synthetic pesticides or fertilisers, offers an even healthier option for those seeking natural and organic products.</p>\n<h3>Nutritional Profile of Maize Flour</h3>\n<p>Maize flour is a nutrition powerhouse. It is high in fibre, aiding in digestion and promoting a feeling of fullness. It also contains essential vitamins and minerals, including B-vitamins, iron, and phosphorus. Moreover, maize flour is a source of antioxidants like beta-carotene and lutein, which help reduce inflammation and promote eye health.</p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"5:1-5:39\"><strong>Nutritional Profile of Maize Flour:</strong></p>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"7:1-7:33\">100 grams of maize flour provide:</p>\n<ul data-sourcepos=\"9:1-18:0\">\n<li data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:20\">Calories: 352 kilocalories</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"10:1-10:20\">Protein: 8.5 grams</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"11:1-11:16\">Fat: 2.3 grams</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"12:1-12:25\">Carbohydrates: 75 grams</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"13:1-13:16\">Fibre: 7 grams</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"14:1-14:22\">Iron: 2.2 milligrams</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"15:1-15:26\">Magnesium: 88 milligrams</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"16:1-16:28\">Phosphorus: 129 milligrams</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"17:1-18:0\">Potassium: 184 milligrams</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Health Benefits of Maize Flour</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Heart Health:</strong> High in fiber, maize flour can help lower cholesterol levels, thus reducing the risk of heart disease.</li>\n<li><strong>Blood Sugar Regulation:</strong> The fibre in maize flour can help regulate blood sugar levels, making it a beneficial choice for individuals with diabetes.</li>\n<li><strong>Anti-inflammatory Properties:</strong> The antioxidants present in maize flour have anti-inflammatory effects, which can help in managing conditions like arthritis.</li>\n<li><strong>Weight Management:</strong> Being rich in fiber, maize flour can aid in weight loss by promoting a feeling of fullness and reducing calorie intake.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Maize Flour in Cooking and Baking</h3>\n<p>Maize flour is highly versatile in the kitchen. It can be used in a variety of recipes, from <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/rye-flour/\">rye</a> bread and muffins to soups and sauces. Its mild flavour and fine texture make it an excellent thickening agent. Additionally, maize flour can be used to make <a title=\"poleta\" href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/polenta/\">polenta</a>, a popular Italian dish, and masa harina, a staple in Mexican cuisine.</p>\n<h3>Comparing Maize Flour to Corn Flour</h3>\n<p>While both are derived from maize, maize flour and <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/lotus-cornflour-maize-500g/\">corn flour</a> differ in texture and processing. Maize flour is whole grain and contains germ and bran, making it more nutritious. Corn flour, on the other hand, is more finely ground and usually more processed.</p>\n<h3>Substitutes for Maize Flour</h3>\n<p>For those looking to substitute maize flour, options include masa harina, polenta, and gluten-free flour alternatives. Each of these substitutes offers unique nutritional and cooking properties.</p>\n<h3>Selecting and Storing Maize Flour</h3>\n<p>When selecting maize flour, look for <a title=\"organic food\" href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/\">suppliers</a> who provide organic and non-GMO options. Store maize flour in a cool, dry place to maintain its freshness and nutritional quality.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>Maize flour is not just a cooking ingredient; it is a nutrient-rich, health-boosting element of a balanced diet. Whether used in traditional recipes or as a substitute for other flours, its benefits are vast and significant. Embracing maize flour in your diet can contribute to better health, aiding in everything from heart health to weight management.</p>\n<h3>References</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://wholegrainscouncil.org/whole-grains-101/whole-grains-a-to-z/whole-grains-corn-maize\" target=\"_new\">Whole Grains Council - Maize Flour</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/foods/corn\" target=\"_new\">Healthline - Nutritional Benefits of Maize</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/diet/health-benefits-corn#1\" target=\"_new\">WebMD - Maize and Heart Health</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.diabetes.co.uk/food/corn.html\" target=\"_new\">Diabetes.co.uk - Maize and Blood Sugar</a></li>\n</ol>",

It is 200-300 times sweeter than table sugar. Some researchers have also classified liquid stevia as a zero-calorie sugar alternative.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\r\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\"><strong>Is Liquid Stevia Better for you?</strong></h2>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Advocates have suggested that organic&nbsp;stevia used as a sweetener in liquid form&nbsp;can benefit the consumer in the following ways:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Being a sugar free sweetener, stevia can offer potential benefits to diabetics. Studies have shown that Stevia can help to substantially decrease blood sugar levels [1] It is important to use stevia products that do not have additives such as dextrose or maltodextrin which can actually increase blood sugar levels. [2] Using stevia sweetener in moderation may help to keep blood sugar levels under control.</span></li>\r\n<li><strong style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Weight control:</strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">&nbsp;Being a sweetener containing no calories, stevia offers the possibility of consuming fewer calories while satisfying that sweet tooth. It has been suggested that an average person consumes about 180 calories through sugar. Switching to liquid stevia can help you reduce that intake by 150 calories.</span></li>\r\n<li><strong style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Lowers high blood pressure:</strong><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">&nbsp;Liquid stevia is also found to be very effective in controlling hypertension and high blood pressure.[3]</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\r\n<h2 class=\"classyschema-faqpage-question\"><strong>Can I use liquid stevia for baking?</strong></h2>\r\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Sugar is not just a sweetener baking ingredient. It also is used to moisten and add body to the end product. Simply replacing sugar with liquid stevia will result in a dry flat cake or whatever other product you're trying to cook. To avoid this we suggest that you follow these steps:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">1: Work out how much sugar is specified in the original recipe. Then substitute 1 teaspoon of liquid stevia sweetener for every cup of sugar required n the recipe.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">2: Mix all of the dry ingredients needed in a large mixing bowl.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">3: To make up the missing sugar bulk, add an extra half cup of liquid per cup of sugar required in the original recipe. Some suggestions include using extra amounts of liquid already present in the recipe or using alternate bulking agents like water, plain yogurt or egg whites.</span></li>\r\n<li><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">4: Finally combine all of the ingredients and add your liquid stevia sweetener. Bake as directed.</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">By following this process sugar can be replaced with liquid stevia to deliver the same great taste while not piling on extra calories that consuming excessive amounts of sugar bring. The substitution amount may require some experimentation according to taste.</span></p>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<!-- END - Generated by ClassySchema.org -->\r\n<h2><br />References</h2>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Antihyperglycemic effects of stevioside in type 2 diabetic subjects<br /><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14681845/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14681845/</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>Compound summary: Dextrose Monohydrate<br /><a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Dextrose_monohydrate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Dextrose_monohydrate</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p>A double-blind placebo-controlled study of the effectiveness and tolerability of oral stevioside in human hypertension<br /><a href=\"https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2125.2000.00260.x\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://bpspubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1046/j.1365-2125.2000.00260.x</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>",

It can also help promote scalp health while encouraging healthy hair growth.</p>\n<h3>Why was castor oil banned?</h3>\n<p>Due to its ricin content, the sale and use of castor oil have been restricted since it can be hazardous for humans and animals alike.

Coarse flour is made using barley groats, while fine flour is made from milled pearl barley.&nbsp; It is also used to create composite flour by adding it to wheat.

It does not work as well for yeast breads as there simply is not enough gluten in barley flour to make the yeast rise. If using barley flour in these tyes of recipes, you will still have to use traditional flour, but can swap out about a quarter for barley flour.

A popular choice for this process is Roma tomatoes, known for their meaty and fleshy consistency, which holds well when grilled.</p>\n<p>Start by slicing the tomatoes in half and brushing them with olive oil. Grill them on a medium flame until they develop dark char marks, and their skins blacken. Once removed from the grill and cooled, peel off the blackened skins and dice the flesh for use in your favourite recipes.</p>\n<h2>Health Benefits of Canned Fire Roasted Tomatoes</h2>\n<h3>Nutritional Advantages of Fire Roasted Tomatoes</h3>\n<p>Canned fire roasted tomatoes are not just a flavourful addition to dishes; they also retain the health benefits of canned tomato products. Rich in fibre, potassium, and vitamins C and E, they contain antioxidants like lycopene and beta-carotene. Interestingly, cooking increases the bioavailability of lycopene, suggesting that fire-roasted tomatoes offer more health benefits than their fresh counterparts.</p>\n<h2>Where to Buy the Best Fire Roasted Tomatoes in Australia</h2>\n<h3>Finding Quality Fire Roasted Tomatoes in Australia</h3>\n<p>If you're wondering where to find the best canned fire roasted tomatoes, Australia offers a range of premium options.

    "description": "<p>Apricot kernels, the seeds found within the stone of apricots, have long been a subject of both nutritional intrigue and health-related controversy. This comprehensive exploration delves into their historical uses, potential health benefits, and, crucially, the potential side effects, including the risks associated with cyanide poisoning.</p>\n<p><strong>Overview of Apricot Kernels</strong></p>\n<p>Apricot kernels are classified into two types: sweet and bitter. Bitter kernels contain significant amounts of amygdalin, which can produce cyanide&mdash;a toxic compound&mdash;when ingested. This risk contrasts starkly with their historical use in traditional medicine across various cultures.</p>\n<p><strong>Historical Use in Traditional Medicine</strong></p>\n<p>In traditional medicinal practices, particularly in Asian cultures, apricot kernels have been used for their perceived therapeutic properties, notably in respiratory health.</p>\n<h3>Section 1: The Benefits of Apricot Kernels</h3>\n<p><strong>Traditional Health Benefits</strong></p>\n<p>Traditionally, apricot kernels have been used for their purported immune-boosting and analgesic properties and as a natural cancer remedy. However, there is no supporting scientific data for these claims.</p>\n<h3>Section 2: Apricot Kernels in Modern Health Practices</h3>\n<p><strong>Current Research and Studies</strong></p>\n<p>Modern research is investigating, but findings still need to be conclusive. The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health highlights the importance of cautious use due to cyanide risks.</p>\n<p><strong>Role in Natural Therapy</strong></p>\n<p>In natural therapy, apricot kernel supplements and oil are noted for their purported health benefits, although these claims often lack solid scientific backing.</p>\n<h3>Section 3: How to Use Apricot Kernels</h3>\n<p><strong>Ingesting Apricot Kernels</strong></p>\n<p>It's critical to adhere to safe consumption guidelines due to the risk of cyanide poisoning.</p>\n<p><strong>Apricot Kernel Oil in Skincare</strong></p>\n<p>The oil is popular in skincare for its moisturising properties.</p>\n<h3>Section 4: Choosing the Right Apricot Kernel Products</h3>\n<p><strong>Selecting Quality Products</strong></p>\n<p>Opt for certified organic products from reputable brands.</p>\n<p><strong>Recommended Products</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apricot Kernel Supplements</li>\n<li>Apricot Kernel Oil</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Section 5: Safety and Risks</h3>\n<p><strong>Potential Risks and Side Effects</strong></p>\n<p>The primary risk associated with apricot kernels is cyanide poisoning. Symptoms range from mild (headaches, dizziness, nausea) to severe (respiratory failure, cardiac arrest). In extreme cases, cyanide poisoning from apricot kernels can be fatal. Although death is rare, it underscores the importance of adhering to safe consumption guidelines. The World Health Organization advises against consuming more than two small bitter apricot kernels per day for adults, with even lower limits for those of lower body weight and vulnerable groups such as pregnant or breastfeeding women.</p>\n<p><strong>Dosage and Precautions</strong></p>\n<p>Adhering to recommended dosages is crucial, especially for at-risk groups.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Apricot kernels are a complex subject; while they hold traditional medicinal value and nutritional benefits, their potential health risks, particularly the danger of cyanide poisoning, must be carefully considered. Understanding their benefits and risks is essential for making informed health choices.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>FAQ Section</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Health Benefits:</strong> Nutrient-rich, with potential anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, though conclusive evidence is lacking.</li>\n<li><strong>Illness Treatment:</strong> No substantial evidence supports their use in treating cancer-related diseases.</li>\n<li><strong>Consumption:</strong> Should be consumed within recommended safety limits.</li>\n<li><strong>Risks:</strong> Cyanide poisoning, potentially fatal in high doses.</li>\n<li><strong>Bitter vs. Sweet Kernels:</strong> Bitter kernels have higher amygdalin levels, increasing cyanide risk.</li>\n<li><strong>External Use:</strong> Apricot kernel oil is used to moisturise skincare.</li>\n<li><strong>Quality Products:</strong> Look for certified organic products from trusted sources.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>Apricot kernels contain amygdalin, a substance that can be metabolized into hydrogen cyanide in the body. Hydrogen cyanide is a poisonous substance that can cause serious health problems, including death. The World Health Organization (WHO) has classified amygdalin (vitamin B17) as a possible human carcinogen. Due to the potential health risks associated with apricot kernels, we recommend that you consult with a healthcare professional before consuming them.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>References:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>NICM Health Research Institute, Australia.</li>\n<li>Australian Traditional Medicine Society.</li>\n<li>National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, U.S.</li>\n<li>PubMed: [\"Current Studies on Apricot Kernels\"].</li>\n<li>Cochrane: [\"Health Impacts of Apricot Kernels Review\"].</li>\n<li>World Health Organization: [\"Guidelines on Apricot Kernel Consumption\"].</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage\">\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-qanda\">\n<div class=\"classyschema-faqpage-answer\">\n<p><span style=\"background-color: #ffffff; font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333;\">At&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333; text-decoration: underline;\"><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Buy Organics Online</a></span><span style=\"font-size: 16px; font-family: Karla, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; color: #333333; background-color: #ffffff;\"> you can purchase apricot kernels that have been sourced from well-known suppliers within the apricot kernel industry.

Unlike many soy sauces, tamari is not made using wheat, whereas many other sauces contain at least 50% wheat.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What is in tamari sauce?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tamari sauce is taken from miso paste which is made up of soybeans, water, salt, koji and moromi. Like soy it is fermented, however, unlike soy sauce little if any wheat is added.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What is tamari sauce made from?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tamari sauce is made by soaking soybeans before boiling them and allowing them to cool. A type of mold called Koji is allowed to grow on the mashed product. Natural yeast and bacteria generated through the process help the mixture to ferment and produce the sauce.Organic tamari is produced using organically grown ingredients and without introducing any synthetic pollutants or ingredients.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tamari is a popular addition to stews, soups, stir fry dishes and dipping sauces and can be readily substituted for soy sauce in any recipe. It can also be used as a condiment for noodle dishes, fish and tofu.</p>\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\">What is the difference between tamari and soy sauce?</h3>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While tamari sauce and soy sauce are interchangeable, both have distinctive flavours and preferences will vary according to taste.

Soy sauce also can have up to 50% wheat contact whereas, tamari has very little wheat content.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Benefits of using tamari</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Besides being gluten free in most instances, tamari has many nutritious benefits.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As with many other fermented foods, tamari soy contains a healthy quantity of peptides, polysaccharides and oligosaccharides. All of these substances are good for the immune system, and digestion. Tamari is also rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidant phenolic acids.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Tamari does not taste quite as sharp as soy sauce due to the absence of wheat and many people prefer its taste to soy sauce.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Where to buy tamari</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Buy Organics Online has a wide selection of <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/table-sauces/\">table sauce</a> products for you to choose from.

    "description": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is rice syrup?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Organic rice syrup sometimes called brown rice syrup or organic rice malt syrup is a sugar substitute derived from cooking brown rice so that it breaks down and converts the rice and starches into sugars, mainly maltose and glucose. Importantly, brown rice syrup contains no fructose.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;Rice syrup&nbsp; is popular because it is all natural and in many cases, organic being derived from rice that has been grown and harvested without the aid of chemicals, pesticides or genetically modified organisms.&nbsp; The syrup is popular with vegans as refined sugar is known sometimes to use bone char from animals in the refining process, whereas rice syrup does not.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Uses of brown rice syrup&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rice syrup is used in pretty much the same way as any other liquid sweetener he can be added to popular drinks like tea or coffee or can be used to add extra sweetness in any recipe.&nbsp; It works really well as a drizzle for waffles, pikelets or pancakes. It can also be used as a dessert topping&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>When cooking with rice syrup it can be used straight out of the jar there is no preparation necessary.&nbsp; It is perfect as a natural sweetener in any recipes that you want to be vegan or gluten-free. Care needs to be exercised when using it with baked recipes as&nbsp; it can cause the dish to be too crispy. Rice syrup does not taste the same as sugar or maple syrup. It is mildly sweet with a faint nutty taste that has been compared to butterscotch&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Where to buy rice syrup</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you have been wondering where can I buy rice syrup in Australia? The answer is <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">Buy Organics Online</a>. We have sourced the very best natural organic rice syrup products available and made them available for you.

Popcorn kernels are whole grain that retain the germ and bran intact. What makes them &ldquo;pop&rdquo; when heated is the moisture inside them that turns to steam as the kernel is heated. Popcorn kernels are loaded with fibre and antioxidants and are extremely low in calories. That doesn&rsquo;t make all popcorn nutritious - some of the commercially produced popcorn is smothered in unhealthy oils. However, when properly prepared organic popcorn kernels popped at home can be full of all that nutrition and goodness.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How to pop popcorn kernels properly.</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To pop corn you need a covered pan and some healthy cooking oil such as olive oil, coconut oil or avocado oil. These ils will add flavour and are full of healthy fats. Stay away from processed oils like sunflower oil which are likely to have fatty oils in them.&nbsp; The pan should be deep enough for the corn to move around in. heat the oil over a medium heat and be careful not to start burning it as the burnt flavour will be transferred to the popcorn. Then add a couple of kernels to the pan and wait for them to pop which will indicate that the oil is at the right temperature.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Then simply add the rest of the popcorn to the pan and cover it for about a minute. Then give the pan a shake and lift the lid enough to allow some steam to escape. Shaking the pan constantly will allow the popped kernels to rise to the top, while the unpopped ones will fall to the bottom and be subjected to the heat of the oil. Pour the popped&nbsp; popcorn into a bowl and allow more room for the unpopped kernels to pop.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Within minutes you will have a delicious and highly nutritious snack.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Where to buy popcorn kernels Australia can trust for nutrition</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you are wondering where to get <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/snacks/\">healthy snacks</a>&nbsp;that have been grown organically, then the place to look is the <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%\">BuyOrganicsOnline</a> online health food store.

Unlike its coarser cousin, almond meal, which uses the entire almond (skin and all), almond flour is a light, white powder with a mild, nutty flavour. This makes it a popular choice for gluten-free baking, but its benefits extend far beyond just avoiding gluten.</p>\n<h3 data-sourcepos=\"7:1-7:26\"><strong>Packed with Nutrition:</strong></h3>\n<p data-sourcepos=\"9:1-9:106\">Don't let the delicate texture fool you &ndash; almond flour packs a serious nutritional punch.

Here are some key tips:</p>\n<ul data-sourcepos=\"20:1-23:0\">\n<li data-sourcepos=\"20:1-20:179\"><strong>Texture:</strong>&nbsp;Almond flour alone can lead to denser baked goods. To achieve a lighter texture, consider blending it with other gluten-free flours like arrowroot or coconut flour.</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"21:1-21:105\"><strong>Eggs:</strong>&nbsp;Eggs play a crucial role in adding structure when using almond flour, so don't skimp on them!</li>\n<li data-sourcepos=\"22:1-23:0\"><strong>Experiment and Explore:</strong>&nbsp;Don't be afraid to get creative!

    "description": "<h2>What are Barley Flakes?</h2>\r\n<p>Barley flakes are made from the cereal grain, pearl barley. Barley is quite similar to wheat and is actually a member of the grass family. Barley flakes are made by removing the outer hull and then steaming and rolling the remainder of the harvested plant. Organic barley flakes are made precisely the same way from organically grown pearl barley.</p>\r\n<p>Barley flakes are small and round in appearance and look similar to <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/rolled-oats/\"><strong>rolled oats</strong></a>. They have a vague nutty flavour and while not a whole grain, as they have been hulled, they still retain some of the benefits of barley. Barley flakes&rsquo; nutrition value is reduced compared to whole grain barley but the flakes will still contain some protein, thiamine, iron riboflavin and other important minerals. Barley is considered to be a valuable nutrition source, however, as flakes have been hulled, some of that nutritional value is lost.</p>\r\n<p>Barley flakes health benefits largely revolve around them being a high fibre source. Fibre is considered to be beneficial in assisting regular and full bowel movements as well as potentially absorbing some potential nasties such as cholesterol.</p>\r\n<h2>Are barley flakes gluten free?</h2>\r\n<p>Unfortunately barley is a whole grain food that contains between 7 and 8 % gluten. Even after having the hull removed, barley flakes are likely to contain traces of gluten and as such should not be consumed by people suffering from celiac disease.</p>\r\n<h2>How to cook barley flakes?</h2>\r\n<p>Cooking barley flakes in their simple form is done in much the same way as cooking oats. Prior to cooking the flakes, it is a good idea to give them a rinse to ensure that they are cleaned and fit for consumption.</p>\r\n<p>Using a conventional stove top and one cup of barley flakes, you should add three cups of water to a saucepan and then bring the water to boil, then add the cup of barley flakes, reduce the heat and allow to simmer for between five and ten minutes. Then remove from heat and allow to cool for about two minutes before serving with milk and <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/honey/\"><strong>honey</strong></a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Using a microwave the process is somewhat similar - combine half a bowl of water with 1 cup of barley flakes, stir then microwave on high for between three and five minutes. Remove the bowl from the microwave and let the flakes stand for two minutes. Then serve.</p>\r\n<h2>How to cook flaked barley?</h2>\r\n<p>As per above. Flaked barley can also be added to other ingredients in a variety of recipes and even used as a pasta or starch substitute in some stews and soups.</p>\r\n<h2>Where to buy barley flakes?</h2>\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for organic barley flakes, then <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/\"><strong>Buy Organics Online</strong></a> is the place for you. All our grain products have been sourced from trusted organic suppliers. If you are looking to increase your fibre intake buy barley flakes here today.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>",

    "description": "<h2>Colloidal Silver Cream: Exploring Potential and Limits</h2><p><strong>Colloidal silver cream</strong>, containing microscopic silver particles suspended in water, has garnered attention for its supposed antibacterial, soothing, and restorative properties. While some potential benefits exist, it's essential to cautiously approach its claims due to limited scientific evidence and potential safety concerns. Let's delve deeper into its possibilities and limitations.</p><p><strong>Possible Benefits:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Limited Antibacterial Activity:</strong> Research suggests colloidal silver may exhibit some antibacterial properties, potentially aiding in wound healing and <strong>mild</strong> skin conditions like acne. However, it's not a substitute for proper wound care or antibiotics.</li><li><strong>Soothing Relief:</strong> Topical application may temporarily relieve mild irritation from insect bites, stings, and minor skin abrasions. It's important to <strong>patch test first</strong> and discontinue use if irritation worsens.</li><li><strong>Individual Benefits:</strong> Some individuals report success using colloidal silver cream for specific skin concerns like eczema or psoriasis. However, <strong>individual experiences vary, and scientific evidence is lacking</strong>.</li></ul><p><strong>Important Considerations:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>No TGA Approval:</strong> Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has not approved colloidal silver for any medical conditions. Its effectiveness claims remain largely unproven and require further research.</li><li><strong>Argyria Risk:</strong> Overuse of colloidal silver, primarily through ingestion, can lead to argyria, a permanent condition where skin, eyes, and organs turn a bluish-grey. <strong>Topical use poses a lower risk, but consult your doctor before using it, especially if you have pre-existing skin conditions.</strong></li><li><strong>Limited Evidence for Specific Uses:</strong> There's insufficient evidence to support using colloidal silver against infections like sinusitis. Do not replace antibiotics or professional medical advice based on anecdotal claims.</li><li><strong>Medication Interactions:</strong> Colloidal silver may interact with certain medications. <strong>Always consult your doctor before using it, especially if you take any medications.</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Misconception Clarification:</strong> Applying <a href=\"https://www.buyorganicsonline.com.au/colloidal-silver/\">colloidal silver</a> cream in recommended amounts will not result in argyria, the bluish-grey skin discolouration associated with excessive silver intake. While argyria remains a potential concern from long-term, high-dose ingestion of silver, the risk associated with topical use is significantly lower. Responsible application according to manufacturer instructions and doctor's recommendations poses minimal risk of skin discolouration.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Responsible Usage:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Always follow manufacturer instructions</strong> regarding dosage and application.</li><li><strong>Store in a cool, dark place</strong> and use within the expiry date.</li><li><strong>Keep children and pets out of reach</strong>.</li><li><strong>Dosage Information:</strong> While there's no universally standardised dosage for colloidal silver cream, some reputable sources suggest the following general guidelines (please note these are for informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for professional medical advice):<ul><li><strong>Minor wounds and skin irritations:</strong> Apply a thin layer to the affected area 1-3 times daily.</li><li><strong>Acne:</strong> Apply a small amount to individual blemishes 1-2 times daily.</li><li><strong>Eczema or psoriasis:</strong> Apply a thin layer to affected areas 2-3 times daily.</li><li><strong>Always follow the specific instructions provided by the product manufacturer.</strong></li><li><strong>Consult your doctor for personalised dosage recommendations based on your condition and needs.</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Alternatives and Proven Treatments:</strong></p><p>Remember, colloidal silver cream should not replace established treatments for wounds, burns, acne, or other conditions. Consult your doctor or dermatologist for diagnosis and proper treatment for persistent or severe concerns.</p><p><strong>Misconceptions and Clarifications:</strong></p><ul><li>Colloidal silver is not a miracle cure and should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.</li><li>It is not recommended for internal use due to the risk of argyria and other potential side effects.</li><li>Applying colloidal silver cream will not turn your skin blue unless misused excessively.</li></ul><p><strong>Further Resources:</strong></p><ul><li>Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA)</li><li>Mayo Clinic: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/NPR/posts/the-mayo-clinic-writes-that-colloidal-silver-is-unsafe-while-the-webmd-result-is/10155871895246756/\">https://www.facebook.com/NPR/posts/the-mayo-clinic-writes-that-colloidal-silver-is-unsafe-while-the-webmd-result-is/10155871895246756/</a>:&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong></p><p>Colloidal silver cream is not a risk-free product.

Iodine is one of the many nutrients that the body requires to function at its optimum. The Western diet has seen many people suffer from iodine deficiency. This has resulted in iodine being offered in a variety of supplemental forms.</p>\r\n<p>While sea salt has some traces of iodine, these are insufficient to make any tangible difference to iodine intake. Iodised sea salt (sometimes spelt iodized) is one way of addressing iodine deficiency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>When taken in moderation, Iodised sea salt benefits include -:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ●&nbsp; Helps to improve the thyroid gland function in producing the hormones that regulate body temperature, blood pressure and heart rate.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ●&nbsp; A healthy thyroid promotes a healthy metabolism that will aid in weight control.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ●&nbsp; Proper iodine intake can help to ensure a healthy pregnancy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ●&nbsp; Helps to remove toxins such as lead from the body.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ●&nbsp; Salt also helps with proper hydration levels.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ●&nbsp;&nbsp;As sea salt is obtained through a drying process, it retains some sea nutrients including important minerals such as potassium, calcium and iron.</p>\r\n<h2>What is the meaning of Iodised sea salt?</h2>\r\n<p>Iodised sea salt is a salt that has been obtained from the sea.

Palo Santo literally means holy wood and burning these sticks is seen as a sacred practice by indigenous tribes of South America who use the sticks to drive out evil spirits. This practice is known as smudging.</p>\r\n<h2>What are Palo Santo Sticks used for?</h2>\r\n<p>Besides the spiritual significance of palo santo, palo santo sticks benefits are tangible and worth investigating. They include the following</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Healing. Traditionally, the wood has been used to ward off colds and flu as well as evil spirits. Advocates today claim that burning these sticks helps to relieve stress as well as reduce the symptoms of asthma, relieve headaches, and assist with relieving anxiety and even depression. <br /> The scent certainly has a calming effect which may help to support both the nervous system and the immune system.</li>\r\n<li>Cleansing - a side product of burning the sticks is that rooms smell fresher and cleaner.

Composed primarily of two proteins, gliadin and glutenin, gluten flour forms when these proteins combine with water.

Flour hydration: Wheat flour is mixed with water to form a dough, allowing the gliadin and glutenin proteins to combine and create gluten.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>B. Washing: The dough is washed to remove starch, bran, and other water-soluble components, leaving behind the insoluble gluten mass.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>C. Drying: The wet gluten mass is then dried, typically using hot air, to remove excess moisture and obtain a stable, powdered product.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>D. Milling: The dried gluten is milled into a fine powder to create the final gluten flour product, which is then packaged and distributed.</span></p>\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Applications</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Gluten flour has a variety of applications in the food industry due to its unique properties, such as:</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A. Dough strengthening: The addition of gluten flour can improve the elasticity and strength of dough, leading to better volume and shape in baked goods.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>B. Protein enrichment: As a concentrated source of plant-based protein, gluten flour can be used to increase the protein content of various food products, including vegetarian and vegan meat alternatives.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>C. Texturizing agent: gluten flour can provide a chewy, meat-like texture to food products, making it a popular choice for creating seitan, a vegetarian meat substitute.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>D. Binding agent: The ability of gluten flour to absorb water and form a cohesive network makes it an effective binder in various food applications, such as meat products and meat analogs.</span></p>\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><strong>Considerations</strong></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>While gluten flour is an essential ingredient for many food applications, it is crucial to note that it is not suitable for individuals with celiac disease, gluten intolerance, or those following a gluten-free diet. Alternative ingredients and formulations must be considered for these populations.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>In conclusion, gluten flour plays a significant role in the food industry, providing essential properties that contribute to the texture, structure, and nutritional value of various food products.

While that&rsquo;s soaking, use all the ingredients except for the sesame seeds and scallions to make the dressing. Combine them all in a bowl and whisk together. Drain the seaweed, then combine with the dressing and sesame seeds.

However, It is reasonable to expect that the seaweed itself will have a bold salty ocean flavour. This is balanced by an array of contrasting flavours that are alternately sweet, toasty and tangy. This makes an interesting and sometimes surprising taste full of variety. Add the complex taste to a crunchy chewy texture and you&rsquo;ve got a salad that is sure to please.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Where to buy Seaweed salad ?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>If you&rsquo;re looking for where to buy seaweed salad, or a mix of quality seaweed salad in Australia, the Buy Organics Online website has a range of pre packaged seaweed salad mixes and assorted other ingredients including premade dressing that are sure to tempt the taste buds.

    "description": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is Sensitive toothpaste?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Having sensitive teeth is a common enough problem to necessitate a number of sensitive toothpaste brands to be available on the market.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Sensitive teeth occur when the sensitive layer beneath the tooth enamel becomes exposed to foods, <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/drinks/\"><strong>drinks</strong></a> and plaque.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Sensitive toothpaste is made to alleviate the pain caused by brushing sensitive teeth and to aid in repairing the tooth enamel.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Careful oral health management can help to manage sensitive teeth. This management includes avoiding foods that will further aggravate the situation and regular careful brushing of the teeth with a sensitive toothpaste.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How to use Sensitive toothpaste?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Treating sensitive teeth requires care and some adjustment in your brushing routine. It is important that as a first step you take the time to work the toothpaste all the way into the toothbrush bristles. While using a toothpaste for sensitive teeth it is recommended that you ensure that you brush your teeth at least twice a day.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>For additional relief you can rub the toothpaste directly onto particularly painful areas. It is recommended that you do this for at least one minute.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>One of the keys to using sensitive toothpaste is to recognise that the teeth have been damaged and relief will be a gradual process. For that reason, it is recommended that you use sensitive toothpaste for at least four weeks - don&rsquo;t give up on it because it doesn&rsquo;t work immediately.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>While some labelling may state that sensitive toothpaste should only be used for a short period, they can be used for prolonged periods without ham. The labelling is there to ensure that people with serious dental problems see a dentist and don&rsquo;t fall back upon relying upon a sensitive toothpaste to fix what may be a serious problem.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is the best toothpaste for Sensitive teeth?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Ideally a sensitive toothpaste should use only natural products to desensitise the teeth while still performing the vital functions of cleaning and whitening. A toothpaste like <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/dr-organic-aloe-vera-toothpaste-100ml/\"><strong>Dr Organic Aloe Vera Toothpaste</strong></a> meets all those criteria.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The toothpaste has all natural organic ingredients including aloe vera, Icelandic&nbsp;moss, silica, horse chestnut and xylitol. The toothpaste has a strong minty flavour and aids oral health. It is highly recommended and we would suggest the best sensitive toothpaste Australia has on the market.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What are the benefits of Sensitive toothpaste?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Naturally the number one benefit of sensitive toothpaste is that it relieves the pain caused by sensitive teeth. However, the benefits don&rsquo;t end there. A natural toothpaste for sensitive teeth that has natural healing properties can also help to heal the teeth and gums. The key benefits of a natural sensitive toothpaste are -:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Soothes pain and helps to rebuild enamel</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Reduces swollen gums</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Freshens your breath</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Xylitol helps to reduce the incidence of cavities</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Reduces plaque</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Has antiseptic properties</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Aids in whitening teeth</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What toothpaste should I use for Sensitive teeth ?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>As we&rsquo;ve already mentioned, Dr Organic Aloe Vera Toothpaste makes an excellent choice if you are looking for a toothpaste for sensitive teeth that has been&nbsp; made from <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/\"><strong>organic natural products</strong></a>. Of course, sensitive toothpaste is not a magic cure and if you are experiencing persistent pain in your teeth, you should consult a dentist.&nbsp;</span></p>",

Traditionally a water bottle was made of glass. However, with the advent of cheap commercial supplies of BPA (Bisphenol A) plastic, plastic water bottles became the popular choice. The problem with BPA plastic is that it can be harmful to your health as the plastic tends to leak harmful substances into the water over time. Additionally, plastic bottles cause a huge environmental hazard that impacts upon our oceans and wildlife. Even when the plastic is recycled only about 20% of it is used.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">With these factors becoming more apparent, there has been a shift towards using sustainable <strong><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/enviro-products-drink-bottle-3-8l/\">large water bottles</a></strong> that are convenient and safe to use. The two preferred big water bottles available for the environmentally aware and the health conscious are stainless steel water bottles and reusable insulated water bottles.</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>So what are large water bottles? As a general rule, any water bottle that has the capacity to hold one litre of liquid or over, could be construed as a large water bottle.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What are the different sizes of water bottles?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The standard sizes for drinking bottles range between 240 mls and 1 litre.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Standard sizes for water bottles are&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>.24 litres (8 oz equivalent)</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>.355 litres (12 oz)</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>.5 litres (16.9 oz)</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>.7 litres (23.7 oz)</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>1 litre (33.8 oz)</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Regardless of which water bottle size that you choose, you can rest assured that all water bottles stocked by Buy Organics Online are BPA free, reusable and recyclable.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is the biggest water bottle size?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Larger drinking bottles designed to store water for groups of people can hold up to 3.8 litres of water. Obviously, bottles of this size are intended to store water for a group of people and may be best used for an office type situation.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Generally, the most suitable large insulated water bottle for personal situations is one litre.

Rice bran should not be confused with other grain brans such as oat or <strong><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/wheat-bran/\">wheat bran</a></strong>. Rice bran cereal benefits are associated with the substances it contains. These substances may help to eliminate bad cholesterol from the body. They also could help reduce calcium absorption which may reduce the likelihood of formation of kidney stones.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">To make the rice bran tasty and appealing some processors flavour the rice bran. <strong><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/lotus-rice-bran-cereal-400g/\">Lotus rice bran cereal</a></strong> for example is lightly flavoured with apple juice.</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Is Rice Bran Cereal good for you?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Advocates of rice bran cereal use rice bran to treat a range of ailments including high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. While the chemical make up of rice bran would tend to support&nbsp; these uses, there hasn&rsquo;t been sufficient clinical research at this stage to categorically state that rice bran is effective in treating these conditions.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>An interesting apparent&nbsp; side benefit of rice bran cereal&nbsp; is that some people use it to treat eczema by rubbing it directly on the skin.

When added to hot and cold liquid, rice flakes swell, much like porridge does. The thickness of <strong>rice flakes </strong>vary from being nearly translucent right through to being four times as thick as a rice grain.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Rice flakes may be eaten raw when immersed in plain water or milk. Salt or sugar can be added according to taste. The flakes can alternatively be lightly fried in oil with nuts, raisins and other spices. They can be added to hot water to make a porridge or paste. The texture and thickness of the <strong>rice flakes</strong> mixture will depend upon the proportion of water added.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rice flakes for babies</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Introducing solids to a <strong>baby&rsquo;s diet</strong> is a matter for discussion between the parents and their pediatrician. Introducing solids too early can pose some choking risks and may lead to obesity. However, rice cereal and therefore rice flakes is generally considered one of the first foods that can be introduced to babies.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>You can introduce rice cereal to the baby&rsquo;s diet by mixing 1 to 2 tablespoons of iron-fortified rice cereal with between 4 and 6 tablespoons of formula, breast milk, or water.

It may take several feedings for the baby to adjust to this new way of feeding.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rice flakes recipes</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rice flakes recipes cover a range of savoury and sweet dishes.

The result is a complete range of fairtrade, organic vegan friendly chocolate that directly supports Peruvian growers and communities. And to top it all off, Bennetto chocolate offsets its carbon footprint by engaging in a rigorous tree planting programme. .</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Bennetto chocolate is truly a breath of fresh air in the chocolate making business. As thor website proudly proclaims that they like doing things differently, love innovation, create new original flavours and enjoy all things natural and edible and they don&rsquo;t add things that have no right to be there.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Key Features and Benefits of Bennetto Chocolate&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Chocolate made by Swiss chocolatiers.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Available in 30g and 100g size bars.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Exciting range of original flavours to tempt your taste buds including Orange with Chilli, Toasted Hazelnut, <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/bennetto-organic-dark-chocolate-mint-and-cocoa-nibs-14x-100g/\"><strong>Dark Chocolate Mint and Cocoa</strong></a> and <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/bennetto-dark-chocolate-raspberry-19x-30g/\"><strong>Dark Chocolate Raspberry</strong></a></span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Grown organically, making it an ethical choice for the environmentally conscious consumer.

    "description": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What are Fragrance Free Shampoo?</h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Fragrance free shampoo is a pretty self explanatory term. You can expect fragrance free shampoo to contain organic or natural ingredients without discernible scents, perfumes or dyes.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>When a shampoo claims to contain a fragrance, the chemicals contained with a fragrance based shampoo are often not disclosed as the manufacturers are trying to protect tier trade secrets.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The key benefit associated with using a fragrance and chemical free shampoo is that your scalp will not be exposed to any chemicals that could potentially irritate the skin. There are a lot of people whose scalp cannot tolerate being subjected to the cocktail of&nbsp; harsh chemicals, and detergents contained in commercially produced fragrant shampoo.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A further benefit of using <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/dr-organic-fragrance-free-shampoo-organic-calendula-265ml/\"><strong>organic fragrance free shampoo</strong></a> is that people who put colour in their hair will have the colour last longer when a fragrance free shampoo is used.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Is Fragrance Free Shampoo better?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>While having hair that smells good can be important for self esteem reasons, there is a school of thought that says that fragrance might be the least important factor to consider when choosing a shampoo, especially if such conditions as itch scalp or dandruff are present.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Fragrance in shampoo is also known to cause dermatitis on your scalp. This is an allergic reaction that presents as itchiness, redness, or as a rash. Often these problems emerge over time as skin becomes \"sensitised\".</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>With all that in mind, there is a reasonable case to say that fragrance free shampoo is better.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Is Fragrance Free the same as unscented?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>While the words fragrance free and unscented appear to be interchangeable, from a consumer&rsquo;s perspective they can mean two different things and it is important to understand this.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Fragrance free is a much safer term As the label suggests, fragrance free means that no fragrances of any variety have been added to the product. If the label is to be believed, you can rest assured that no artificial fragrances have been added and as artificial fragrances are known to contain phthalates which irritate the skin, fragrance free makes a good choice. This does not mean that a fragrant free shampoo will not have any smell, as any natural products contained in the formula will retain their scent.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Unscented on the other hand can indicate that some sort of masking agent has been used to hide the smell of other products. If a masking agent was used then, there is a fair chance that it was composed of toxic phthalates.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Where can I buy </span><span>Fragrance Free Shampoo</span><span>?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>If you have been looking for the finest fragrance free shampoo products in Australia, then you will find that the range of products at <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/\"><strong>Buy Organics Online</strong></a> is more than suitable for your needs.

A half cup of golden syrup, 3 cups of plain flour, 1 tbsp ground ginger, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, 1 tsp of bicarb soda.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Method</span><span>: Line two oven trays with baking paper and preheat the oven to 180 degrees. Use a small saucepan to combine the&nbsp; butter, sugar and golden syrup. Stir these ingredients over low heat until fully melted. Once combined, transfer the ingredients to a large mixing bowl. Beat the mixture until it attains a light fluffy texture (electric beaters are preferred), then allow the mixture to cool a little. Gently sift the flour, cinnamon, ginger and soda together, then fold them into the original mixture. Make sure that the spices are well combined into the mixture. Then gently roll the mixture into tablespoon sized balls.&nbsp; Arrange the balls on the&nbsp; trays, leaving space between each ball. Use a fork to slightly flatten each ball.

    "description": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What does a Hair Spray do?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Hairsprays essentially form what could be seen as an invisible hair net when it is sprayed on hair. What it does is It coats hair strands in a sheer light film connecting individual hair fibres wherever they touch. As the hairspray dries, the connecting hairs effectively bond and are held in place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To get the best results from hairspray you should know how to use it properly. A common misconception is that the spray should be sprayed close to the roots, this is incorrect as this method tends to soak the hair and give it a greasy appearance. It is therefore recommended that the hair spray container be held 15 centimeters&nbsp;away from the head while spraying. By doing this you will get a better hold and coverage of spray on hair.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How to make Hair Spray with essential oils?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>A simple hair spray recipe using essential oils calls for one cup of purified or distilled water., 25 drops of essential oils (preferably rosemary, with a touch of lavender) and 1 tablespoon of <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/organic-sugar/\"><strong>organic sugar</strong></a> or <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/coconut-sugar/\"><strong>coconut sugar</strong></a>. Simply heat the water in a saucepan and bring to a simmer. Then remove from heat and add sugar. Whisk the solution until all sugar is dissolved. Then allow it to cool before adding the essential oil. Store the solution in a spray bottle and shake well before use.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How to use Hair Spray for curling?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To get the best results with curling, begin by spraying your hair with a light to firm hairspray before curling. This will reduce the risk of the hair falling flat. When you do spray, be sure that you give it a light spray and don&rsquo;t fall for the trap of saturating it..&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is a good Hair Spray?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>When considering the question which spray is best for hair, we would recommend a natural hair spray that is not loaded with potentially harmful chemicals that can dry and harm your hair. For that reason we stock products like <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/giovanni-la-hold-hair-spray-147ml/\"><strong>Giovann hair sprays</strong></a>.

Heel balm is essentially a moisturizer&nbsp;that may contain some extra ingredients which will help with exfoliation and the breaking down of calluses and dead skin removal. While the name suggests that heel balm has been produced for heels specifically, it can be applied to other areas of the body.,&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is Heel Balm used for?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Heel balm is often used to simply touch up the driest, roughest areas to keep their feet smooth. On the other hand, others' needs can be a little more demanding. The balm can be used to heal painful deep heel cracks. Diabetics also used heel cream to deal with the effects that diabetes can have on their feet, although care needs to be exercised in this regard as some balms can be too exfoliating or cause damage to the feet in other ways.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Frequent users of heel balm recommend several strategies to get the most value from the product. These include-:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Apply the heel balm before bed and then sleep with socks on, so that the moisture of the balm is locked in.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>You can smooth the appearance of dry skin before wearing sandals or thongs by touching up the skin with heel balm before putting the sandals on.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>As some heel balms have quite a strong scent, it is perhaps prudent to apply the balm at night rather than at the start of the day.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Many users of heel balm believe it to be more effective when used immediately after exfoliation.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Can I put Heel Balm on my face?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Surprisingly, heel balm can be used for a variety of purposes. It has been used as a soothing cream, a rash treatment, lip balm, hand cream and when rubbed on the chest can act as a decongestant. Besides working effectively as a lip balm that soothes cracked dry lips, it can be used as a <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/face-creams/\"><strong>face cream</strong></a> and has been said to be most effective for dry skin. It does not work well under makeup as it tends to make faces look unnaturally shiny.

A key point to understand here is that scalp treatments offered by hair salons that offer little more than a scalp massage may help to ease tension, but will provide little benefit in terms of scalp health or hair growth.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>There are, however, a variety of scalp treatment products that can help with easing such problems as an itchy scalp and even promoting hair growth. The best scalp treatment product will depend upon what the actual problem is. Scalp problems can range from oiliness, to a condition colloquially known as cradle cap through to dandruff, acne and of course problems associated with hair loss.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How do you treat Scalp problems?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The treatment of scalp problems is likely to vary on a case by case basis. However, there are a few methods that can be applied to suit particular problems.</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Scalp acne treatment will require the use of an exfoliating scalp scrub, to help clear away dead scaly skin. A gentle scrub like the Giovanni D Tox Exfoliating Scalp Scrub will help to remove flaky skin and cleanse the pores while the addition of some <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/tea-tree-oil/\"><strong>tea tree oil</strong></a> in either a shampoo or just a few drops applied directly will help to treat the acne directly.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Oily scalp treatment will require an application that will help to dry the scalp and restore it to its natural state. Consistently rinsing your hair in running water will help to do this. Shampoos and conditioners that can help will contain such natural ingredients as coal tar or activated charcoal Giovanni&rsquo;s D Tox Exfoliating Scrub once again fills the bill here.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Dry scalp treatment will require a restoring hair treatment like<a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/dr-organic-hemp-oil-restoring-hair-scalp-treatment-150ml/\"><strong> Dr Organic&rsquo;s Hemp Oil</strong></a> restoring hair treatment is perfect for dry and normal hair. It is known to promote hair growth, acts as a natural moisturiser and improves blood circulation in the scalp.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What shampoo is good for Scalp fungus?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Fungal infections are more common than most people realize&nbsp;and&nbsp; scalp fungus infections can affect people of all ages. The causes of scalp fungus are varied as there are many types of fungus which can cause scalp irritation and annoying itching. If scalp fungus is ignored, it can cause hair loss and in some cases, baldness.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Shampoos with natural antifungal properties are going to work best. As a general rule look for shampoos that contain ingredients such as tea tree oil, honey, aloe vera, oregano oil and ginger. One of the best organic antifungal shampoos available is <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/dr-organic-tea-tree-shampoo-265ml/\"><strong>Dr. Organic&rsquo;s Organic Tea Tree Shampoo</strong></a>. This shampoo cleanses and repairs hair while having additional antiseptic qualities.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>There is no secret to using&nbsp; antifungal shampoos- they basically should be used as you would use a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; shampoo. However, it is always best to read the directions for use prior to using a shampoo for the first time. The recommended procedure for using a shampoo to treat fungal infections should be something similar to to this</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Thoroughly wet your hair with water&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Apply a small dollop of antifungal shampoo.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Massage the shampoo into the hair and create a lather.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Thoroughly clean your scalp using your fingers to work the lather around your scalp.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Allow the shampoo to remain in your hair for around five minutes.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Then rinse your hair thoroughly in running water.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How often Scalp Treatment?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The regularity of scalp treatments will vary according to conditions and any directions on the particular product labels.

    "description": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What are Unscented Deodorant?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>An unscented deodorant is an odorless product that has been developed to effectively mask or even prevent unwanted and potentially embarrassing body odour. There are a range of <strong>unscented solid deodorant</strong> and unscented gel deodorant products on the market that perform this function.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is the point of Unscented Deodorant?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>There is a significant market for <strong>unscented deodorant</strong> and the reasons for the demand vary. The key reasons that unscented deodorant is growing in popularity are-:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Many women in particular do not want a deodorant that conflicts with their chosen perfume fragrance. Many people see the fragrance that their perfume has an extension of themselves and do not want that fragrance to be diluted.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Scented deodorants invariably have more ingredients in them than unscented deodorants and with each ingredient there is an increased risk of skin irritation. We all react a little differently to various ingredients. Unscented deodorants have less ingredients and therefore carry less risk of irritating the skin.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Unscented deodorants are unisex in nature. If there is no scent, there is no scent. Whereas most fragrant scents will have a feminine or masculine appeal.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Many deodorants have a strong fragrance that simply masks body odour rather than eliminates it. Unfortunately, this often results in a rather unpleasant odour that is a mixture of body sweat and deodorant. This makes unscented deodorant an appealing option for people concerned that the deodorant is not fighting the bacteria that causes odour but simply masking the smell with varying degrees of success.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Is it bad to have fragrance in deodorant?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Having fragrance is very much a personal choice and everyone will have their own personal choice. The primary function of deodorant is to prevent body odour. Perfumes and aftershaves are more suitable for people looking for fragrance. With that said, some people will prefer a fragrant deodorant. Natural fragrances are of course better and there is much conjecture about the ingredients in deodorants. For this reason it is probably best to avoid deodorants with heavy fragrances and a lot of unnatural ingredients.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is the best Unscented Deodorant?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Again, what is the best <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/nutribiotic-unscented-deodorant-75g/\"><strong>unscented deodorant</strong></a> will come down to personal choice. You can choose from an unscented gel deodorant, an unscented solid deodorant or some form of <strong><a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/crystal-unscented-deodorant-spray-118ml/\">unscented spray deodorant</a></strong>. Some people search for Schmidts unscented deodorant and while Schmidts offer a good range of products, we would suggest that there are a range of unscented deodorants that perform the necessary function of safely eliminating body odour.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Unscented Deodorant</span><span> reviews?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Deodorant choice is a very personal thing and it is difficult to get universal endorsement for any particular product. If you spend some time online, you will discover a lot of positive reviews for various unscented deodorants. The deodorant products chosen by Buy Organics Online all have positive reviews.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Where can I buy </span><span>Unscented Deodorant</span><span>?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>If you have been looking for the best unscented deodorant products that have been produced with your health in mind, then you will find the range of products at <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/\"><strong>Buy Organics Online</strong></a> more than suitable for your needs.

    "description": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What is wheat bran?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">The wheat bran is the hard outer layer of the wheat kernel, The wheat bran is full of nutritional value and fibre, but is often discarded during the milling process, which tends to focus on the endosperm and wheat germ. <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/lotus-wheat-bran-organic-300g/\"><strong>Wheat bran</strong></a> is often considered a wheat byproduct, but this description drastically undersells its value. The wheat bran itself has a nutty taste and is often used as an ingredient in foods like bread and muffins.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What is Wheat Bran used for?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wheat bran is a pretty versatile cooking ingredient and can be used to add texture to a range of dishes. Alternatively, it can be added as a topping to various foods. Some suggested ways to use wheat bran are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Sprinkle it lightly on breakfast meals such as cold cereal or warm porridge.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Use it to add body to soups and casseroles.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Add it to smoothies for extra body.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Add it to recipes that use bread crumbs by mixing it into the breadcrumb mix and breading your fish with a mixture of wheat bran and bread crumbs.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Add wheat bran to pancake mixtures.</p>\n</li>\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Add wheat bran to breads or muffins.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What foods contain wheat bran?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As wheat bran is a high source of fibre, its prevalence in foods is well worth knowing about. High levels of wheat bran can be found in whole grain breads, a variety of wheat bran breakfast cereals, and some cooked muffins.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">You can add more wheat bran to your diet by incorporating it into your home recipes or using the tips outlined above.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Are wheat bran and wheat germ the same?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wheat bran and wheat germ come from the same plant but are separate parts of the wheat grain, Both parts are full of goodness but used in different ways.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Is wheat bran good for weight loss?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">One easy adjustment you can make to your diet if you&rsquo;re looking to lose weight is to replace your usual breakfast cereal with a high-fiber cereal containing wheat bran. Adding more dietary fibre to your diet may help you lose weight.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Wheat bran cereal and wheat bran flakes are excellent sources of fibre. However, before choosing a cereal, you should take some time to research your choice of cereal. Some key points to consider are that a good wheat bran cereal should typically list 100 percent whole wheat as the first ingredient. It should have as little sugar as possible (less than eight grams), and also more than five grams of fibre.</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">Where can I buy wheat bran in Australia?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">If you have been looking for wheat bran that has been obtained from organically grown and processed wheat, then you will find all you need at Buy Organics Online. Choose the best wheat bran available from our range of carefully sourced ethically and organically grown products.

However, there is very little evidence of clinical studies of the effectiveness of detox foot pads.

The apparent conflict between research and anecdotal evidence is muddied even further by the range of detox foot pads available.

Ghee is an Indian version of clarified butter except that the Indian method takes the extra step of caramelising the milk solids.&nbsp;</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">As the name suggests, <a href=\"%%GLOBAL_ShopPathSSL%%/golden-ghee-co-ghee-grass-fed-685g/\"><strong>grass fed ghee</strong></a> is obtained by processing the milk of a grass fed cow.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">It is widely accepted that cows produce the best quality milk when they are fed a diet of quality green grass. Grass fed cow milk contains a load of antioxidants, vitamins, and the good kind of saturated fats.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Ghee tastes somewhat similar to butter but its separation and caramelisation process gives it a hint of nuttiness to taste. The taste is likely to vary slightly depending upon the quality of milk used to produce it - hence grass fed ghee is likely to taste better as well as being better for you..</p>\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\">What is the difference between Grass-Fed Butter and Ghee?</h2>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">Grass-fed butter vs Ghee has become quite the debate in some food circles. Both have their advocates and for many, the choice comes down to a simple matter of taste. However, grass-fed ghee does have some distinct advantages when compared to grass-fed butter.</p>\n<p dir=\"ltr\">While grass fed butter is full of nutrients so too is grass fed ghee. The deciding factor for many is that ghee does not contain casein or lactose.

Green tea is derived from the leaves of the Camellia Sinensis plant and is widely consumed in Japan. There are several popular varieties of green tea which can be divided into two categories - those grown in the shade and those grown in the sun.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Varieties of green tea grown in the shade include the very popular Matcha and Gyokuro varieties.

Leaves determined to become black tea are left to dry and ferment. This process causes the tea to oxidise and take on the earthy flavours that are associated with black tea. Whereas green tea is obtained by steaming the leaves almost immediately.

So, what are they and how do they differ from steel cut or rolled oats? </span><span><br /></span><span><br /></span><span>Essentially quick oats are steamed in much the same way as rolled oats. The&nbsp; difference is that the oat groats are rolled much more thinly than regular rolled oats. This causes them to break apart a little, giving them the appearance of being roughly chopped. The reduction in size results in less cooking time - hence the name quick oats. While the cooking time is reduced the taste and flavour of quick oats remains the same. Quick oats have a slightly different texture to traditional rolled oats, being thinner and creamier. They also retain all the goodness of other oat forms. </span><span><br /></span><span><br /></span><span>Organic quick oats are organic oats that have been grown without the aid of chemicals or synthetic fertilisers and steamed in the same way.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Benefits of quick oats</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Quick oats retain all the benefits of regular oats and being less dense get absorbed into the bloodstream quicker. The key benefits of oats are -:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Promotes better digestion as they have high fibre content</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Helps to lower bad cholesterol levels and blood pressure leading to a healthier heart.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Slows down the absorption of sugar into the body helping to keep blood sugar levels under control&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Being high in fibre, oats tend to promote the feeling of a full stomach while being low in fat and low in carbohydrates making them a weight control ally.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>High concentration of antioxidants helps to build your immune levels.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Gluten free cereal makes it suitable for sufferers of celiac disease.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Quick oats of course have the added benefit of taking less time to cook, while retaining all these benefits.

    "description": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What Is Bircher Muesli?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Bircher Muesli, first introduced by Swiss physician Maximilian Bircher Benner at the dawn of the 20th century, is the forerunner to what we today call muesli. The physician noticed that a balanced meal of raw vegetables and fruits combined with&nbsp;regenerative therapy was having a positive impact upon his patients.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Most popular brands of muesli today are derivatives of the original bircher muesli recipe. Unfortunately, most mass produced muesli cereals either have added sugar or salt - and bot these additives tend to detract from the overall health benefits that Bircher Muesli provides.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Fortunately, there are still some companies that adhere to the original recipe and produce organic bircher muesli made from locally produced fruit and vegetables.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is the difference between Bircher muesli and regular muesli?</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Bircher muesli is the traditional muesli version of what many people know as overnight oats. While the modern regular muesli is crunchy and dry, bircher mueslis are usually made to be soaked for a period before eating. Cream and lemon juice are too popular choices added to soak bircher muesli in.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What are the Health Benefits of Bircher Muesli?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Bircher muesli is a healthier alternative to conventional mueslis or cereals for the following reasons.</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>It helps to keep bowel movements regular. While this can be said of most mueslis and cereals, the high gout healthy fibre content of Bircher muesli helps to alleviate symptoms of constipation while promoting overall gut health.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Does not contain ingredients that could be classified as harmful. </span><span><br /></span><span>While a lot of cereals make all sorts of claims about being healthy and good for you, many contain a list of ingredients guaranteed to baffle you. Those long sounding scientific names often disguise potentially harmful preservatives and chemicals not to mention the dreaded sugar and salt components..</span><span><br /></span><span>Whereas, Bircher muesli is made from natural food ingredients that haven&rsquo;t&nbsp; been altered or stripped of their natural goodness. A good example of Bicrher muesli contents would be Real Good Foods&rsquo; Organic Bircher Muesli. The contents of this package are instantly recognisable Rolled Oats, Sultanas, Sliced Almonds, Diced apple and sunflower kernels - no added sugar or salt - just natural goodness.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Is easily digestible and helps with the absorption of nutrients.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Bircher muesli should be soaked overnight as this helps to break down the starch content in rolled oats making the digestion process easier. Additionally, this process decreases the phytic acid content of the muesli. Phytic acid naturally occurs in every plant-based ingredient. Its presence slows down the absorption rate of nutrients and minerals such as calcium iron and zinc.</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Oats have been demonstrated to assist in lowering high blood cholesterol levels.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Some varieties of nuts used in Bircher muesli contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids Omega-3 is widely connected to a raft of health benefits, including assisting with the development of the nervous system.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The Bircher muesli is a high-calorie and healthy heart food.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Can help to reduce sugar levels provided no sugar or honey is added.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>How to Make Bircher Muesli&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This Bircher muesli recipe serves two people, and is really a guide as ingredients can be carried according to taste</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>This can be made with fruit juice, soya milk or rice milk. Alternatively you could opt for the original&nbsp; recipe&nbsp; ingredients which stipulated water and cream. It is recommended that you trial&nbsp; different ingredient combinations.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Variety is the spice of life here. You can swap out the walnuts for almonds and the fruits are interchangeable. Blueberries are a sure hit. Be careful though with sharp tasting fruits like pineapple which could contrast with the sultana taste.</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>&nbsp;Ingredients&nbsp;</span></h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Rice milk, soya milk&nbsp; or fruit&nbsp; juice (orange)</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>4 large scoops of oats</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>1 scoop of sultanas</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>6 strawberries</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>1 banana</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>2 apples</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>1 scoop of walnuts</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>1/2 of a lemon</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Method</span></h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To ensure that the sultanas become soft and juicy and to lower the scratch content of the oats, Bircher muesli should be prepared the night before.&nbsp; This preparation will involve:</span></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Pouring the oats and sultanas into a large&nbsp; mixing bowl.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Thoroughly mixing them together</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Add your chosen milk or juice to the bowl without covering the oats.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Stir it all together.

Typically no grains are used in a granola pack and you could assume that it is therefore gluten free. However, many packaged granola products use oats that have been tainted with grain during processing. Many of these cereals therefore cannot be certified as gluten free granola.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>To be gluten free granola, the oats and other ingredients must not have been contaminated with grain during harvest or processing. The products selected by Buy Organics Online not only meet that criteria but also use ingredients that have been grown organically - giving you the opportunity to choose organic gluten free granola.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Gluten Free Granola Recipe&nbsp;</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Home made gluten free granola is a relatively simple process, provided you can source gluten free products at reasonable prices and you enjoy getting your hands dirty in the kitchen.

Tigernut is a tuber that grows from the chufa sedge plant.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The flour is obtained by first roasting the tubers and then grinding the roasted roots into&nbsp; powder. While not strictly comparable to wheat flour it can still be added to baked goods or used as a thickening agent for gravies,&nbsp; soups or stews. It also makes a useful flavouring addition to&nbsp; many foods ranging from jam to ice cream.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Tigernut flour is becoming increasingly popular as it is gluten free and paleo diet friendly.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h3 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What does tigernut flour taste like?</span>&nbsp;</h3>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The tigernut tuber has a distinctive but mild, slightly nutty flavor. As with many root vegetables it has a sweet earthy taste. </span><span><br /></span><span>This translates across to the flour which&nbsp; is slightly sweeter grain flours.

Magnesium aids more than three hundred biochemical actions and reactions within the body.

This particular variety of cacao is now highly sought after due to the rapid introduction of hybridized rapidly growing cacao plants that produce greater quantities of beans but lack the quality of flavour of the original beans.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Loving Earth in&nbsp; partnership with the rainforest foundation has assisted the Ashaninka community to form a certified organic, fair trade cooperative.

Other nutrients contained in this triangular seed include -:B Vitamins, zinc, magnesium, iron manganese and copper,. However the raw seeds contain phytic acid which prevents the vitamins and minerals from being accessible. The way to unlock that goodness is to activate the seed. Activation requires soaking, draining and then dehydrating the seeds.</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Loving Earth have sourced quality organically grown and harvested buckinis and packaged them up in a variety of interesting and delightful flavours.

    "description": "<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is Unbleached Flour?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>As the name suggests, unbleached flour is milled flour that has not been through the bleaching process. Bleached flour is treated with chemicals such as benzoyl peroxide, potassium bromate, chlorine gas, and other chemicals to whiten it, thus removing its natural yellow tinge. Unbleached flour is allowed to age naturally and this takes extra time. The extra processing time usually results in slightly higher prices for unbleached flour. When used for baking, unbleached flour usually delivers a coarser, crustier result.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Bleached flour vs unbleached flour - what is best?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Bleached flour is renowned for its fineness and it makes baking, somewhat easier in most instances. However, some recipes specifically call for unbleached flour and this is generally to ensure that a certain texture is achieved.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Aside from baking, unbleached flour has several distinct advantages over bleached flour. These are-:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Unbleached flour has greater nutritional value than bleached flour as it retains some vital nutrients that the bleaching process leaves out. Unbleached flour has more fibre, contains more antioxidants and retains the minerals manganese and copper as well as Vitamin E.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Unbleached flour has a protein content of around 11% compared to bleached flour which has a protein content of 8%.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The chemicals used in the bleaching process are potentially harmful. Potassium bromate is the main cause for concern as it has been linked to kidney damage in studies. Benzoyl peroxide has also been linked to the body&rsquo;s inability to break down antioxidants.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>While these concerns about bleached flour are real, the consensus of opinion is that more research needs to be done before a definitive conclusion can be reached.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Bread flour vs unbleached flour - which one should you use?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Bread flour is specifically made for bread making. Usually, bread flour has been bleached which means that many of the advantages and disadvantages of bleached flour compared to white flour can be applied here.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is Unbleached Flour used for?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Unbleached flour can readily be interchanged with bleached flour in most recipes. It will provide a denser end result. It is best suited to recipes that require the food to hold its shape. This makes unbleached flour perfect for recipes for &eacute;clairs, pastries and yeast bread.</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Where to buy organic Unbleached Flour.</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Searching for natural unbleached flour is no longer a problem, as Buy Organics Online offers a range of unbleached flours that have been chosen for their natural goodness. If you&rsquo;re looking to transition away from white flour or simply need unbleached flour for a specific recipe, buy your supply today from Buy Organics Online.</span></p>",

Ayurveda is a traditional form of Indian medicine.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Ayurvedic medicine operates on the principle that your skin&rsquo;s health reflects the whole body&rsquo;s health. As the skin is your body&rsquo;s largest organ, it is capable of absorbing way more nutrients than you might realise. Ayurvedic soap is made from organic ingredients with the idea of nourishing the skin. Gentle on the skin, it is a natural and holistic means of skincare designed to deliver clean healthy moisturised skin all over.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>An Ayurvedic soap recipe is not just a recipe for cleansing and nourishing the skin. The soap bars are infused with aromatic herbs that can help to improve your mood and state of mind.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>Benefits of Ayurvedic soap</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The Ayurvedic lifestyle requires a change in mindset and an acknowledgement that any natural thing when used properly, acts as a type of medicine. This is particularly so for what is applied topically and what scents that you may breathe in. Even everyday morning rituals such as showering or washing your face can contribute to your overall health.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The key benefits of using Ayurvedic soap are:</span></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The naturally made soap retains antioxidant properties which help with skin cell rejuvenation, This helps with keeping skin looking healthy.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Contains natural antibacterial agents that help to prevent acne and other related conditions.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Minimises health risks associated with parabens and sulphates found in regular soap. These chemicals can be absorbed into the body and may be harmful to your overall health.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>More environmentally friendly than regular soap. Made from all-natural ingredients, Ayurvedic soap is easily biodegradable, making it less harmful to the environment. Regular soaps tend to contain chemicals that can be quite toxic to the environment and they have the potential to disrupt marine life in particular.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Helps to keep skin looking youthful. The soap contains many ingredients that help to maintain the skin&rsquo;s complexion and elasticity.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Free from animal fat. Not tested on animals.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Naturally moisturises the skin and helps to prevent ailments such as dermatitis.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li dir=\"ltr\">\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>Ayurvedic soap is made up of a cocktail of natural herbs that have natural&nbsp; restorative and recuperative powers. They not only enrich your skin but have the power to enliven and nourish your senses as well.&nbsp; Science has now conclusively demonstrated that our sense of smell can have a direct effect on our emotions. Some natural scents can have a significant impact upon our state of mind and emotional well being.&nbsp; Ginger and lavender, for example, are both known to have a relaxing, calming effect on the body.</span></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2 dir=\"ltr\"><span>What is in Ayurvedic soap?</span></h2>\r\n<p dir=\"ltr\"><span>The ingredients of this soap may vary slightly according to individual recipes but the ingredients list of Chandrika Ayurvedic Soap gives a reasonable sample of what is contained in Ayurvedic soap.
