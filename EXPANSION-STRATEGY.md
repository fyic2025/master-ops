## 📈 PHASE 2: SCALING BEYOND 27K/MONTH

### Why You Need More Capacity

Current situation:
- 7,833 leads available (beauty + fitness)
- At 4 emails per lead = 31,332 total emails
- Current quota: 27,000/month
- **You need 16% more capacity for ONE round**

For ongoing outreach:
- Follow-up campaigns to previous leads
- New lead acquisitions
- Multiple campaigns running simultaneously
- Re-engagement sequences

### How to Scale Smartlead

#### Option 1: Upgrade Smartlead Plan

**Current Plan:** Likely on basic plan (27K/month)

**Upgrade Options:**
1. **Growth Plan:** ~50,000 emails/month
   - Cost: ~$149-199/month
   - Capacity: 12,500 leads/month (4 emails each)
   - Best for: Testing multiple verticals

2. **Scale Plan:** ~100,000 emails/month
   - Cost: ~$299-399/month
   - Capacity: 25,000 leads/month
   - Best for: Aggressive growth

3. **Enterprise:** 200K+ emails/month
   - Cost: Custom pricing
   - Capacity: 50K+ leads/month
   - Best for: Full-scale operations

**To Upgrade:**
1. Go to: https://app.smartlead.ai/settings/billing
2. Click "Upgrade Plan"
3. Select higher tier
4. Updated quota available immediately

#### Option 2: Add More Email Accounts

**Current Setup:** 10 email accounts @ 540 emails/day each

**How Email Accounts Increase Capacity:**
- Each email account = 540 emails/day limit
- 10 accounts × 540 = 5,400 emails/day
- 5,400 × 5 days/week × 4 weeks = 108,000/month theoretical max
- BUT: Smartlead plan limits total monthly sends

**To Increase:**
1. Add more email accounts (Google Workspace or Outlook)
2. Configure in Smartlead Settings → Email Accounts
3. Warm up new accounts (2-3 weeks before full volume)
4. Distribute sends across all accounts

**Email Account Costs:**
- Google Workspace: $6/user/month
- Microsoft 365: $6/user/month
- Add 5 more accounts = $30/month extra
- Increase daily capacity to 8,100/day

#### Option 3: Multiple Smartlead Accounts

**Strategy:** Run separate Smartlead accounts for different verticals

**Setup:**
- Account 1: Beauty campaigns (current)
- Account 2: Fitness campaigns (new)
- Each has own 27K quota
- Total capacity: 54K/month

**Pros:**
- Double capacity without upgrading
- Separate tracking per vertical
- Isolate deliverability issues

**Cons:**
- 2× monthly cost (~$200/month total)
- Manage 2 separate dashboards
- Split email accounts between both

## 🔧 PHASE 3: EMAIL INFRASTRUCTURE

### Your Current Email Setup

**Sending Email:** jayson@teelixir.com (confirmed access)

**What You Need:**

#### 1. Dedicated Sending Domains
❌ **Don't send cold emails from @teelixir.com main domain!**

**Why:** Protects your main domain reputation. If cold emails get marked as spam, it won't affect:
- Your regular business emails
- Order confirmations
- Customer service emails
- Internal communications

**Setup Dedicated Domains:**

Buy 2-3 similar domains:
- teelixir-partners.com.au
- teelixir-wholesale.com.au
- teelixir-ambassadors.com.au

**Cost:** $15-20/year per domain

**Email Setup:**
- Create email accounts: jayson@teelixir-partners.com.au
- Use Google Workspace or Microsoft 365
- Configure SPF, DKIM, DMARC records
- Warm up accounts before sending volume

#### 2. Email Account Warming

**Critical:** New email accounts can't send 540 emails/day immediately!

**Warming Schedule:**
- Week 1: 10 emails/day per account
- Week 2: 20 emails/day
- Week 3: 50 emails/day
- Week 4: 100 emails/day
- Week 5: 200 emails/day
- Week 6: 540 emails/day (full volume)

**Smartlead has auto-warming:** Enable in Settings → Email Accounts → Warmup

#### 3. Recommended Email Setup for Scale

**For 50K emails/month:**
- 15-20 email accounts
- 3 dedicated domains (5-7 accounts per domain)
- All accounts warmed up
- Google Workspace Business Standard ($12/user)

**Monthly Cost:**
- Domains: $5/month (3 domains)
- Email accounts: $180-240/month (15-20 accounts)
- Smartlead Growth: $149-199/month
- **Total: ~$350-450/month**

**Sending Capacity:**
- 20 accounts × 540/day = 10,800 emails/day
- 10,800 × 22 business days = 237,600 emails/month theoretical
- Limited by Smartlead plan (50K realistic)
