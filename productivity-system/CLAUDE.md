# Productivity System

## Purpose
Strategic execution engine that ensures daily work drives business growth through ACRA framework alignment (Attract, Convert, Retain, Ascend). Eliminates busy work, detects productivity patterns, and maintains brutal prioritization across multiple business operations.

## Core Philosophy
- **Ruthless Prioritization**: Only work that moves ACRA metrics forward
- **Pattern Detection**: Identify time sinks and infrastructure-over-priorities traps
- **Strategic Alignment**: Every task must connect to business growth
- **Autonomous Operations**: Build systems that run without you
- **Concise Action**: Maximum 15 bullet points per output

## Business Context
- **Primary**: RedHillFresh.com.au (delivery ops Thu-Fri)
- **Focus**: AI automation & autonomous operations
- **Model**: Multiple business streams
- **Goal**: Build systems that attract, convert, retain, and ascend customers

## Workflows

### Daily Planning (Morning Ritual)
**Trigger**: Start of workday
**Goal**: Brutal prioritization aligned with ACRA framework

1. Review yesterday's log for patterns
2. Check strategic alignment across businesses
3. Identify top 3 ACRA-driving tasks
4. Kill anything that's infrastructure theater
5. Output: Max 15 prioritized actions

**ACRA Alignment Check**:
- Attract: Does this bring new customers?
- Convert: Does this turn prospects into buyers?
- Retain: Does this keep customers active?
- Ascend: Does this increase customer value?

### End-of-Day Assessment
**Trigger**: End of workday
**Goal**: Honest productivity audit and pattern detection

1. Log actual work completed
2. ACRA alignment score (1-10)
3. Time sink identification
4. Pattern detection (infrastructure vs priorities)
5. Strategic drift warnings
6. Tomorrow's focus shift

### Weekly Review
**Trigger**: End of week
**Goal**: Strategic course correction

1. Aggregate daily logs
2. Pattern analysis across projects
3. ACRA framework performance
4. Time allocation vs ROI
5. Strategic realignment

## Anti-Patterns to Detect

### Infrastructure Theater
- Building tools instead of using existing ones
- Premature optimization
- "Perfect system" syndrome
- Research rabbit holes

### Strategic Drift
- Working IN business instead of ON business
- Urgency trumping importance
- Reacting instead of executing strategy
- Feature creep without customer demand

### Time Sinks
- Excessive planning without action
- Meetings without decisions
- Email/admin creep
- Context switching across too many projects

## Logging Structure

### Daily Log Format
```
DATE: YYYY-MM-DD
BUSINESS: [RedHillFresh | Other]
FOCUS AREA: [Attract | Convert | Retain | Ascend]

PLANNED:
- [Task 1]
- [Task 2]
- [Task 3]

COMPLETED:
- [Actual work done]

TIME ALLOCATION:
- Strategic work: Xh
- Operational work: Xh
- Infrastructure: Xh
- Time sinks: Xh

ACRA ALIGNMENT: X/10
PATTERN DETECTED: [Infrastructure theater | Strategic drift | On track]
TOMORROW'S SHIFT: [Adjustment needed]
```

## Success Metrics
1. Daily ACRA alignment score >7/10
2. Strategic work >50% of total time
3. Infrastructure work <20% of total time
4. Pattern detection rate (catching drift early)
5. Week-over-week reduction in time sinks
