### Email 3: Objection Handler (Day 5)
**Timing:** Day 5, 10am-3pm AEST
**Goal:** Address common objections, create urgency

#### Universal Template (Works for All)
```
Subject: Last note - Teelixir for {{company_name}}

Hi {{first_name}},

I get it - adding new products takes time and consideration.

But since I've reached out a couple times, I wanted to address what typically holds {{primary_category}} businesses back:

**"We don't have shelf space"**
→ Our products are compact (11 bestsellers fit in 30cm of shelf space)

**"Our clients won't buy premium supplements"**
→ If they're paying for your services, they value quality. Average basket: $120-150.

**"The minimum is probably too high"**
→ $200 to start. That's 5-7 products. Most orders are $600+.

**"We need to try before committing"**
→ Happy to send samples. No obligation.

**"Not sure about margins"**
→ Products retail $45-60, you pay $22-30. 50-100% markup.

**"What if it doesn't sell?"**
→ 30-day return policy. Plus, our sell-through rate is 85%+.

Still interested? Just reply "yes" and I'll send:
1. Sample pack (your team can try everything)
2. Wholesale price list
3. Best starter package for {{primary_category}}

Or, honestly, I'll close your file and won't bother you again.

Your call.

Jayson
Teelixir Wholesale

P.S. - If now's not the right time, no worries. The offer stands whenever you're ready.
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Acknowledges their lack of response (builds rapport)
- ✅ Proactively handles ALL major objections
- ✅ Specific numbers (shelf space, pricing, margins)
- ✅ Creates decision point (yes or close file)
- ✅ Respectful tone (not pushy)
- ✅ PS keeps door open

### Email 4: Breakup Email (Day 7-10)
**Timing:** Day 7-10, any time
**Goal:** Final engagement attempt, respectful exit

#### Template (Universal)
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out a few times about Teelixir wholesale for {{company_name}}.

Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming now isn't the right time.

I'll go ahead and close your file unless you'd like to keep the conversation open?

Just reply:
• "Yes" if you'd like wholesale info
• "Not now" if you'd like me to follow up in 3-6 months
• "Not interested" and I'll remove you from our list

Appreciate your time either way.
