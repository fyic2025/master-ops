Quick context: We work with 300+ beauty, spa, and wellness
businesses across Australia who retail our products.

Your clients would love:

- Still leaves door open

#### Email 4: Breakup Email (Day 7-10)
**Subject:** "Should I close your file?"

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Haven't heard back, so I'll assume now isn't the right time
for Teelixir at [Business Name].

I'll close your file unless you'd like to keep the
conversation open?

Just reply "yes" if you'd like wholesale info.

Appreciate your time either way.

[Sender]

P.S. - Offer stays valid if you change your mind later.
```

**Why This Works:**
