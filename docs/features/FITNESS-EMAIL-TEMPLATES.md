## EMAIL 1 - Day 1 (Immediate Send)

**Subject:**
```
Quick revenue idea for {{company_name}}
```

**Body:**
```
Hi there,<br><br>

Quick question for {{company_name}}:<br><br>

Would you display a poster in your gym/studio if it earned you passive income every month — without stocking products or changing anything about your training?<br><br>

<b>Here's how it works:</b><br>
→ We give you a custom QR code poster<br>
→ Your members scan it and order performance nutrition online<br>
→ You earn commission on every order<br>
→ We ship directly to them<br><br>

No inventory. No handling. No risk.<br><br>

We're Teelixir — functional mushroom supplements (Cordyceps, Lion's Mane, Reishi) used by 15,000+ athletes and health-conscious Australians. You've probably seen our products at health stores or on Instagram.<br><br>

<b>Your members get:</b> Clean performance nutrition they actually want (pre-workout energy, recovery, focus)<br>
<b>You get:</b> 10-15% commission on all orders tracked to your code<br><br>

Some fitness businesses earn $200-800/month. Depends on your member base, obviously.<br><br>

<b>Interested?</b><br>
Apply here (2 mins): https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=fitness_blast<br><br>

Or just reply with "tell me more" and I'll send details.<br><br>

Teelixir<br><br>

P.S. - If you'd rather stock products at your front desk for better margins (40%), we do wholesale too. But Ambassador is easier to start.

## EMAIL 2 - Day 3 (48 hours after Email 1)

**Subject:**
```
What your members are already buying (you're just not earning from it)
```

**Body:**
```
Hi,<br><br>

Following up on the Teelixir Ambassador idea.<br><br>

Here's the thing:<br><br>

Your members are <b>already</b> buying supplements. Pre-workout, protein, recovery stuff.<br><br>

They're buying from Chemist Warehouse, iHerb, Instagram ads... whoever.<br><br>

<b>But they're not buying from you.</b><br><br>

Why? Because you don't stock products (smart — inventory is a pain).<br><br>

So here's the solution:<br><br>

<b>Teelixir Ambassador Program:</b><br>
• Put up one poster with a QR code<br>
• Members scan it → see our range → order online<br>
• We fulfill & ship everything<br>
• You earn 10-15% commission automatically<br><br>

<b>Real example:</b><br>
CrossFit gym in Melbourne, 150 members.<br>
Earns $400-600/month just from the poster.<br>
They don't touch inventory. Don't even mention it in class.<br>
Poster does 100% of the work.<br><br>

<b>What we're offering you:</b><br>
• Custom poster designed for your space<br>
• Unique QR tracking code<br>
• Monthly commission payouts<br>
• Product samples to try first<br><br>

<b>Our products (high demand in fitness):</b><br>
• Cordyceps - Natural pre-workout energy, endurance<br>
• Lion's Mane - Mental focus, clarity<br>
• Reishi - Sleep, recovery, stress relief<br>
• Chaga - Immune support, inflammation<br>
• Protein Blends - Mushroom + plant protein<br><br>

No caffeine crashes. No jitters. Clean, functional ingredients.<br><br>

Want in?<br>

Takes 2 minutes to apply.<br><br>

P.S. - If you want to stock products instead (front desk sales, 40% margins), that's an option too. Just mention it in the application.

## EMAIL 3 - Day 5 (48 hours after Email 2)

**Subject:**
```
Why you haven't replied (probably)
```

**Body:**
```
Hi,<br><br>

I've reached out twice about the Teelixir Ambassador program.<br><br>

You haven't replied, so let me guess what you're thinking:<br><br>

<b>"Sounds too good to be true"</b><br>
→ Fair. But we have 200+ gyms and studios earning commission this way. It's how modern wellness brands scale without traditional retail.<br><br>

<b>"My members won't scan a QR code"</b><br>
→ QR adoption is 85%+ now. Most gyms see 5-12% of members scan over time. That's passive income from people who were buying supplements anyway.<br><br>

<b>"I don't want to push products on members"</b><br>
→ You literally don't mention it. Poster goes near the bathroom or exit. Members discover it naturally. Zero sales pitch required.<br><br>

<b>"What's the catch?"</b><br>
→ No catch. We need distribution in fitness spaces. You have members. We pay you for access. Simple partnership.<br><br>

<b>"Takes too much time to set up"</b><br>
→ 2-minute application. We design the poster. You put it up. That's it. Payouts are automatic.<br><br>

<b>"What if nobody orders?"</b><br>
→ Then you made $0 and lost 2 minutes. But realistically, if you have 50+ members, you'll get orders. We see consistent conversion across gyms.<br><br>

<b>"I'd rather stock products and make more"</b><br>
→ That's an option too (40% wholesale margins). But Ambassador has zero inventory risk. Test it first, then decide.<br><br>

Still on the fence?<br><br>

Just reply <b>"send me info"</b> and I'll share:<br>
• Example earnings by gym size<br>
• Sample poster designs<br>
• How commission tiers work<br>
• Full partner testimonials<br><br>

Or apply directly: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=fitness_blast<br><br>

Your call.<br><br>

Jayson<br><br>

P.S. - Honest question: What would you need to see/know to feel comfortable trying this?

## EMAIL 4 - Day 7 (48 hours after Email 3)

**Subject:**
```
Last email (and a breakdown)
```

**Body:**
```
Hi,<br><br>

This is my last email about the Ambassador program.<br><br>

I get it — your inbox is full, you're busy running a gym/studio, and another partnership pitch probably isn't your priority.<br><br>

But before I close this out, let me break down the <b>actual math</b> so you can decide if this makes sense:<br><br>

<b>SCENARIO: Small Studio/Gym (50 members)</b><br><br>

→ 5-8% of members scan QR code over 3 months (typical)<br>
→ Let's say 4 members order (conservative)<br>
→ Average order: $60-80 (2-3 products)<br>
→ Your commission: 10-15% = $6-12 per order<br>
→ Plus repeat orders (most customers reorder monthly)<br><br>

<b>Month 1:</b> 4 orders × $8 avg commission = $32<br>
<b>Month 2:</b> 2 new + 3 repeat = $40<br>
<b>Month 3:</b> 2 new + 4 repeat = $48<br><br>

<b>Result:</b> $120 in 90 days from a poster you put up once.<br><br>

Not life-changing money. But it's passive. And it compounds as more members discover it.<br><br>

<b>SCENARIO: Mid-Size Gym (150 members)</b><br><br>

→ 7% scan rate = 10 members order<br>
→ Average $70 order<br>
→ Commission: 10-15%<br><br>

<b>Month 1-3:</b> $300-500 total<br>
<b>After 6 months:</b> $400-700/month recurring<br><br>

Pays for your gym insurance. Or equipment. Or just... extra cash flow.<br><br>

<b>SCENARIO: Large Facility (300+ members)</b><br><br>

→ 8-10% conversion<br>
→ 25-30 members order<br>
→ Recurring orders build up<br><br>

<b>After 6 months:</b> $800-1,200/month recurring<br><br>

Some gyms clear $1,500+/month after a year. But that's not typical. Depends on your vibe and how health-conscious your members are.<br><br>

<b>The point:</b><br><br>

This isn't a get-rich scheme. It's a <b>low-effort, zero-risk revenue stream</b> that grows over time.<br><br>

If you're thinking "that's not enough money to bother"... fair enough. This isn't for you.<br><br>

But if you're thinking "huh, that's basically free money for putting up a poster"... then yeah, you get it.<br><br>

<b>Ready?</b><br>
→ https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=fitness_blast<br><br>

Or reply "not interested" and I'll stop emailing. No hard feelings.<br><br>

P.S. - If you'd rather explore wholesale (stocking products at front desk), mention that in the application. Different model, higher margins, but requires inventory.

## ALTERNATIVE CAMPAIGN: WHOLESALE FOCUS (Optional)

If you want to target fitness businesses with **wholesale stocking** instead of Ambassador:

### EMAIL 1 - Wholesale Version

**Subject:**
```
Stock Teelixir at {{company_name}} front desk?
```

**Body:**
```
Hi there,<br><br>

Quick question for {{company_name}}:<br><br>

Would you stock functional mushroom supplements at your front desk if members are asking for them?<br><br>

We're Teelixir — you've probably seen our products at health stores or on Instagram.<br><br>

<b>Why gyms/studios stock us:</b><br>
• Members ask for pre-workout alternatives (no caffeine crash)<br>
• High margins: 40% wholesale<br>
• Fast-moving products (not slow inventory)<br>
• Premium positioning ($30-50 retail)<br><br>

<b>Top sellers in fitness spaces:</b><br>
• Cordyceps - Natural energy & endurance<br>
• Lion's Mane - Focus & mental clarity<br>
• Reishi - Recovery & sleep<br>
• Protein blends - Mushroom + plant protein<br><br>

We offer a starter pack (low commitment) to test what your members want.<br><br>

Interested in wholesale terms?<br>
→ https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=fitness_wholesale<br><br>

Or reply and I'll send the product list + pricing.<br><br>

Jayson<br>
Teelixir<br><br>

P.S. - If you don't want to carry inventory, we have an Ambassador option (QR code poster, commission-based). Zero stock required.
