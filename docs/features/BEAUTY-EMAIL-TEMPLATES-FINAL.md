### Email 1: Value Introduction (Day 1)
**Subject:** Earn from your existing massage/spa clients

**Body:**
```
Hi there,

Quick question for {{company_name}}:

Would you be interested in earning 10-25% commission just by having a poster in your space?

No inventory, no investment, no selling required.

Here's how it works:
→ We give you a custom QR code poster
→ Your clients scan it and order online
→ You earn commission on every order
→ We ship directly to them

Teelixir makes premium organic mushroom supplements (think: beauty from within, stress relief, better sleep). Perfect fit for wellness-conscious spa & massage clients.

300+ Australian businesses already earning passive income this way.

Interested? Takes 2 minutes to apply:
https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_massage_spa

(Or if you'd rather stock products for 40% margins, that's an option too)

### Email 3: Objection Handler (Day 5)
**Subject:** Why you haven't replied (probably)

**Body:**
```
Hi,

I've reached out twice about the Teelixir Ambassador program.

You haven't replied, so let me guess what you're thinking:

**"Sounds too good to be true"**
→ Fair. But we have 300+ partners earning commission this way. It's how modern DTC brands grow.

**"My clients won't scan a QR code"**
→ QR adoption is 85%+ now (thanks, COVID menus). Our data shows 8-15% of people who see the poster scan it.

**"I don't want to be pushy or salesy"**
→ You literally don't mention it. Poster does the work. You're just offering an option.

**"What's the catch?"**
→ No catch. We need distribution, you have clients. We pay you for access.

**"Takes too much time to set up"**
→ 2-minute application. We design the poster. You put it up. Done.

**"What if nobody orders?"**
→ Then you made $0 and lost 2 minutes. But realistically, if you have 20+ clients/week, you'll get orders.

**"I'd rather stock products and make more"**
→ That's an option too (40% margins). But Ambassador has zero risk.

Still on the fence?

Just reply "send me info" and I'll share:
• Example earnings by business type
• Sample poster designs
• How commission tiers work
• Full partner testimonials

Or apply directly: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_massage_spa

Your call.

Jayson

P.S. - Honest question: What would you need to see/know to feel comfortable trying this?

### Email 4: Breakup (Day 7)
**Subject:** Closing your file

**Body:**
```
Hi,

This is my last email about the Teelixir Ambassador program.

I've reached out a few times, haven't heard back.

I'm going to assume it's not a fit for {{company_name}} right now.

Before I close your file, here's the TL;DR:
• Earn 10-25% commission from your existing clients
• We give you a QR code poster (free)
• No inventory, investment, or selling required
• Takes 2 minutes to apply
• Zero risk (if nobody orders, you lost nothing)

If you want to try it: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_massage_spa

If not, no worries at all. I'll leave you alone.

Either way, all the best with {{company_name}}.

Jayson

P.S. - Quick reality check: In the 5 minutes it took you to read my 4 emails, you could've applied and had a poster up already earning commission. Just saying. 😊

### Email 2: Social Proof (Day 3)
**Subject:** Beauty salons averaging $250-400/month

**Body:**
```
Hi,

Quick data on what hair & beauty salons are earning as Teelixir Ambassadors:

**Average salon results:**
→ 4-8 orders per month
→ $250-400 commission monthly
→ Just from a poster in the salon

**Why it works in salons:**
Your clients already:
• Care about beauty & wellness
• Trust your recommendations
• Spend 30-60 min in your space (time to scan QR)
• Want "beauty from within" solutions

**The poster literally does the work:**
1. Client sits in chair
2. Sees poster about mushroom beauty supplements
3. Scans QR code
4. Orders online (free shipping over $100)
5. You get 10-25% commission

No selling, no inventory, no hassle.

**What partners love:**
✓ Complements their services (not competing)
✓ Builds their wellness brand
✓ Monthly samples to try products
✓ Clients appreciate the recommendation

Apply: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_hair_beauty

If it doesn't work? Literally zero loss.
If it does? $2,500-5,000/year extra income.

## 📧 CAMPAIGN 3: COSMETIC & AESTHETIC (272 contacts)

### Email 1: Value Introduction (Day 1)
**Subject:** Passive income opportunity for cosmetic practices

**Body:**
```
Hi,

Given your focus on cosmetic/aesthetic services, I wanted to share a zero-risk revenue opportunity.

Teelixir Ambassador Program:
• Earn 10-25% commission on client orders
• No inventory or upfront investment
• Custom QR code poster for your clinic
• We handle fulfillment & shipping
• Monthly sample sachets (so you can try everything)

We're Australia's leading organic adaptogen brand (8+ years, certified organic, third-party tested). Our products complement aesthetic treatments perfectly - think "beauty from within".

Many cosmetic clinics & med spas use this to:
→ Generate passive income from existing clients
→ Offer wellness products without stocking
→ Position themselves as holistic practitioners

Apply: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_cosmetic

(Takes 2 minutes, no commitment)

P.S. - If you'd rather stock products for retail (40% margins), that option exists too. But Ambassador is the easy entry point.

**Typical clinic results:**
