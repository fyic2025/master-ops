Hi there,

Quick question for {{company_name}}:

Would you be interested in earning 10-25% commission just by having a poster in your space?

No inventory, no investment, no selling required.

Here's how it works:
→ We give you a custom QR code poster
→ Your clients scan it and order online
→ You earn commission on every order
→ We ship directly to them

Teelixir makes premium organic mushroom supplements (think: beauty from within, stress relief, better sleep). Perfect fit for wellness-conscious spa & massage clients.

300+ Australian businesses already earning passive income this way.

Interested? Takes 2 minutes to apply:

(Or if you'd rather stock products for 40% margins, that's an option too)

• Just from having a poster up

**How commissions work:**

**What you get:**

Hi,<br><br>

I've reached out twice about the Teelixir Ambassador program.<br><br>

You haven't replied, so let me guess what you're thinking:<br><br>

<b>"Sounds too good to be true"</b><br>
→ Fair. But we have 300+ partners earning commission this way. It's how modern DTC brands grow.<br><br>

<b>"My clients won't scan a QR code"</b><br>
→ QR adoption is 85%+ now (thanks, COVID menus). Our data shows 8-15% of people who see the poster scan it.<br><br>

<b>"I don't want to be pushy or salesy"</b><br>
→ You literally don't mention it. Poster does the work. You're just offering an option.<br><br>

<b>"What's the catch?"</b><br>
→ No catch. We need distribution, you have clients. We pay you for access.<br><br>

<b>"Takes too much time to set up"</b><br>
→ 2-minute application. We design the poster. You put it up. Done.<br><br>

<b>"What if nobody orders?"</b><br>
→ Then you made $0 and lost 2 minutes. But realistically, if you have 20+ clients/week, you'll get orders.<br><br>

<b>"I'd rather stock products and make more"</b><br>
→ That's an option too (40% margins). But Ambassador has zero risk.<br><br>

Still on the fence?<br><br>

Just reply "send me info" and I'll share:<br>
• Example earnings by business type<br>
• Sample poster designs<br>
• How commission tiers work<br>
• Full partner testimonials<br><br>

Or apply directly: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_massage_spa<br><br>

• Earn 10-25% commission from your existing clients
• We give you a QR code poster (free)
• No inventory, investment, or selling required

Either way, all the best with {{company_name}}.

Hi,

Bit cheeky, but hear me out.

What if you could earn 10-25% commission from your beauty clients WITHOUT:
• Buying inventory
• Using shelf space
• Training staff
• Doing any selling

Sound too good to be true?

It's our Ambassador program:
→ We give you a branded poster with QR code
→ Put it in your salon/treatment room
→ Clients scan, order premium beauty supplements
→ You earn commission, we ship to them

Products: Organic mushrooms for beauty (Tremella = "beauty mushroom", Pearl Beauty Tonic, adaptogens)

Average partner earns $150-400/month passive income.

Apply here (2 min): https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_hair_beauty

Worth exploring?

Beauty salons averaging $250-400/month
```

**Body:**
```
Hi,

Quick data on what hair & beauty salons are earning as Teelixir Ambassadors:

**Average salon results:**
→ 4-8 orders per month
→ $250-400 commission monthly
→ Just from a poster in the salon

**Why it works in salons:**
Your clients already:
• Care about beauty & wellness
• Trust your recommendations
• Spend 30-60 min in your space (time to scan QR)
• Want "beauty from within" solutions

**The poster literally does the work:**
1. Client sits in chair
2. Sees poster about mushroom beauty supplements
3. Scans QR code
4. Orders online (free shipping over $100)
5. You get 10-25% commission

No selling, no inventory, no hassle.

**What partners love:**
✓ Complements their services (not competing)
✓ Builds their wellness brand
✓ Monthly samples to try products
✓ Clients appreciate the recommendation

Apply: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_hair_beauty

If it doesn't work? Literally zero loss.
If it does? $2,500-5,000/year extra income.

Hi,

Given your focus on cosmetic/aesthetic services, I wanted to share a zero-risk revenue opportunity.

Teelixir Ambassador Program:
• Earn 10-25% commission on client orders
• No inventory or upfront investment
• Custom QR code poster for your clinic
• We handle fulfillment & shipping
• Monthly sample sachets (so you can try everything)

We're Australia's leading organic adaptogen brand (8+ years, certified organic, third-party tested). Our products complement aesthetic treatments perfectly - think "beauty from within".

Many cosmetic clinics & med spas use this to:
→ Generate passive income from existing clients
→ Offer wellness products without stocking
→ Position themselves as holistic practitioners

Apply: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_cosmetic

(Takes 2 minutes, no commitment)

P.S. - If you'd rather stock products for retail (40% margins), that option exists too. But Ambassador is the easy entry point.

```
Passive income for aesthetic practices
```

**Body:**
```
Hi,

Wanted to share how cosmetic clinics are using Teelixir's Ambassador program.

**Why it works for aesthetic practices:**

Your clients already invest $300-1,500+ in treatments. They're HIGHLY motivated to support results with quality supplements.

**Typical clinic results:**
→ 5-10 orders per month
→ $300-600 commission monthly
→ Zero inventory or staff time required

**Perfect for your clientele:**
• Evidence-based adaptogens (not woo-woo)
• Certified organic, third-party tested
• Complements aesthetic treatments (beauty from within)
• Premium positioning aligns with your practice

**How it integrates:**
→ QR code poster in treatment rooms
→ Clients scan while waiting
→ We handle orders, shipping, customer service
→ You get 10-25% commission

**Products that resonate with aesthetic clients:**
• Tremella (internal skin hydration)
• Pearl Beauty Tonic (skin radiance)
• Schizandra Berry (skin nourishing)

Apply: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support?utm_source=smartlead&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=beauty_blast_cosmetic

Think of it as: $3,000-7,000/year passive income for putting up a poster.
