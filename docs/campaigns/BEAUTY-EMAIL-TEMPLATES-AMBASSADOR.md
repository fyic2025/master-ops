Subject: Free money for {{company_name}}?

Hi {{first_name}},

Bit cheeky, but hear me out.

What if you could earn 10-25% commission from your beauty clients WITHOUT:
• Buying inventory
• Using shelf space
• Training staff
• Doing any selling

Sound too good to be true?

It's our Ambassador program:
→ We give you a branded poster with QR code
→ Put it in your salon/treatment room
→ Clients scan, order premium beauty supplements
→ You earn commission, we ship to them

Products: Organic mushrooms for beauty (Tremella = "beauty mushroom", Pearl Beauty Tonic, adaptogens)

Average partner earns $150-400/month passive income.

#### Version C: Cosmetic/Medical Aesthetic Focus
```
Subject: Passive income opportunity for {{company_name}}

Hi {{first_name}},

Given {{company_name}}'s focus on {{primary_category}}, I wanted to share a zero-risk revenue opportunity.

Teelixir Ambassador Program:
• Earn 10-25% commission on client orders
• No inventory or upfront investment
• Custom QR code poster for your clinic
• We handle fulfillment & shipping
• Monthly sample sachets (so you can try everything)

We're Australia's leading organic adaptogen brand (8+ years, certified organic, third-party tested). Our products complement aesthetic treatments perfectly - think "beauty from within".

Many cosmetic clinics & med spas use this to:
→ Generate passive income from existing clients
→ Offer wellness products without stocking
→ Position themselves as holistic practitioners

Apply: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support
(Takes 2 minutes, no commitment)

P.S. - If you'd rather stock products for retail (40% margins), that option exists too. But Ambassador is the easy entry point.

#### Version B: Hair & Beauty Salon
```
Subject: Beauty salons averaging $250-400/month

Hi {{first_name}},

Quick data on what hair & beauty salons are earning as Teelixir Ambassadors:

**Average salon results:**
→ 4-8 orders per month
→ $250-400 commission monthly
→ Just from a poster in the salon

**Why it works in salons:**
Your clients already:
• Care about beauty & wellness
• Trust your recommendations
• Spend 30-60 min in your space (time to scan QR)
• Want "beauty from within" solutions

**The poster literally does the work:**
1. Client sits in chair
2. Sees poster about mushroom beauty supplements
3. Scans QR code
4. Orders online (free shipping over $100)
5. You get 10-25% commission

No selling, no inventory, no hassle.

**What partners love:**
✓ Complements their services (not competing)
✓ Builds their wellness brand
✓ Monthly samples to try products
✓ Clients appreciate the recommendation

Apply: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support

If it doesn't work? Literally zero loss.
If it does? $2,500-5,000/year extra income.

```

#### Version C: Cosmetic/Medical
```
Subject: Passive income for aesthetic practices

Hi {{first_name}},

Wanted to share how cosmetic clinics are using Teelixir's Ambassador program.

**Why it works for aesthetic practices:**

Your clients already invest $300-1,500+ in treatments. They're HIGHLY motivated to support results with quality supplements.

**Typical clinic results:**
→ 5-10 orders per month
→ $300-600 commission monthly
→ Zero inventory or staff time required

**Perfect for your clientele:**
• Evidence-based adaptogens (not woo-woo)
• Certified organic, third-party tested
• Complements aesthetic treatments (beauty from within)
• Premium positioning aligns with your practice

**How it integrates:**
→ QR code poster in treatment rooms
→ Clients scan while waiting
→ We handle orders, shipping, customer service
→ You get 10-25% commission

**Products that resonate with aesthetic clients:**
• Tremella (internal skin hydration)
• Pearl Beauty Tonic (skin radiance)
• Schizandra Berry (skin nourishing)

Apply: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support

Think of it as: $3,000-7,000/year passive income for putting up a poster.

Worth exploring?

**Why These Work:**
- ✅ Real numbers (monthly earnings, order counts)
- ✅ Segment-specific results (spa vs salon vs clinic)
- ✅ Emphasizes "zero work" and "passive"
- ✅ Risk mitigation (worst case = $0)
- ✅ Specific products that work for their clients

### Email 3: Objection Handler (Day 5)
**Timing:** Day 5, 10am-3pm AEST
**Goal:** Address why they haven't responded yet

#### Universal Template (Works for All)
```
Subject: Why you haven't replied (probably)

Hi {{first_name}},

I've reached out twice about the Teelixir Ambassador program.

You haven't replied, so let me guess what you're thinking:

**"Sounds too good to be true"**
→ Fair. But we have 300+ partners earning commission this way. It's how modern DTC brands grow.

**"My clients won't scan a QR code"**
→ QR adoption is 85%+ now (thanks, COVID menus). Our data shows 8-15% of people who see the poster scan it.

**"I don't want to be pushy or salesy"**
→ You literally don't mention it. Poster does the work. You're just offering an option.

**"What's the catch?"**
→ No catch. We need distribution, you have clients. We pay you for access.

**"Takes too much time to set up"**
→ 2-minute application. We design the poster. You put it up. Done.

**"What if nobody orders?"**
→ Then you made $0 and lost 2 minutes. But realistically, if you have 20+ clients/week, you'll get orders.

**"I'd rather stock products and make more"**
→ That's an option too (40% margins). But Ambassador has zero risk.

Still on the fence?

Just reply "send me info" and I'll share:
• Example earnings by business type
• Sample poster designs
• How commission tiers work
• Full partner testimonials

Or apply directly: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support

Your call.

Jayson

P.S. - Honest question: What would you need to see/know to feel comfortable trying this?
```

**Why This Works:**
- ✅ Acknowledges their silence (builds rapport)
- ✅ Lists ALL common objections
- ✅ Specific data (85% QR adoption, 8-15% scan rate)
- ✅ Emphasizes zero risk repeatedly
- ✅ PS invites them to share concerns

### Email 4: Breakup Email (Day 7-10)
**Timing:** Day 7-10, any time
**Goal:** Final attempt, respectful exit

#### Template (Universal)
```
Subject: Closing your file

Hi {{first_name}},

This is my last email about the Teelixir Ambassador program.

I've reached out a few times, haven't heard back.

I'm going to assume it's not a fit for {{company_name}} right now.

Before I close your file, here's the TL;DR:
• Earn 10-25% commission from your existing clients
• We give you a QR code poster (free)
• No inventory, investment, or selling required
• Takes 2 minutes to apply
• Zero risk (if nobody orders, you lost nothing)

If you want to try it: https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support

If not, no worries at all. I'll leave you alone.

Either way, all the best with {{company_name}}.

Jayson

P.S. - Quick reality check: In the 5 minutes it took you to read my 4 emails, you could've applied and had a poster up already earning commission. Just saying. 😊
```

**Alternative Version (Softer):**
```
Subject: {{first_name}}, last note

Hi {{first_name}},

Last email, I promise.

I respect that you're busy and passive income from a poster might not be a priority.

If you ever want to explore it (literally zero downside), the program is here:
https://teelixir.com.au/pages/teelixir-wholesale-support

Otherwise, I'll close your file and won't reach out again.

Appreciate your time.

Jayson

P.S. - If you know another {{primary_category}} business that might want easy passive income, feel free to send them this link.
```

**Why These Work:**
- ✅ Creates urgency (closing file, last email)
- ✅ Summarizes entire value prop in 5 bullets
- ✅ Light humor in PS (humanizes sender)
- ✅ Respectful tone (not desperate)
- ✅ Leaves door open for future
