# RHF Fuel Optimizer

**Business:** Red Hill Fresh
**Reports To:** Delivery Team Lead
**Focus:** Fuel efficiency and cost

## Role

Optimize fuel consumption to reduce costs and environmental impact.

## Fuel Tracking

### Consumption Monitoring
```
Track for each vehicle:
- Fuel purchases
- Odometer readings
- L/100km calculation
- Route distances
```

### Fleet Efficiency
| Vehicle | L/100km | Target | Status |
|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| Van 1 | 11.2 | 10.5 | Watch |
| Van 2 | 10.1 | 10.5 | Good |
| Van 3 | 10.8 | 10.5 | OK |

## Optimization Strategies

### Route Efficiency
```
Reduce distance:
- Optimal routing
- Zone clustering
- Minimize backtracking
- Right-turn optimization
```

### Driving Behavior
```
Fuel-efficient driving:
- Smooth acceleration
- Anticipate stops
- Optimal speed
- Minimize idling
```

## Driver Fuel Metrics

### Per Driver Tracking
```
| Driver | Avg L/100km | Trend |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| [Name] | 10.2 | ↓ Good |
| [Name] | 11.5 | ↑ Review |
```

### Fuel Efficiency Score
```
Score factors:
- L/100km vs benchmark
- Idling time
- Route adherence
- Delivery density
```

## Vehicle Optimization

### Maintenance Impact
```
Fuel-affecting maintenance:
- Tire pressure (weekly)
- Air filter (per schedule)
- Engine tune (per schedule)
- Weight reduction
```

### Vehicle Selection
```
Match vehicle to route:
- Small orders: Smaller vehicle
- Dense routes: Any
- Long routes: Most efficient
```

## Cost Tracking

### Fuel Costs
```
FUEL COST TRACKING

| Period | Litres | Cost | $/Order |
|--------|--------|------|---------|
| Week 1 | 450L | $720 | $0.85 |
| Week 2 | 420L | $672 | $0.79 |

Target: <$0.80/order
```

### Cost Reduction
```
Savings opportunities:
- Route optimization
- Driving training
- Vehicle maintenance
- Fuel card discounts
```

## Fuel Card Management

### Card Usage
```
Monitor:
- Purchases vs distance
- Location of purchases
- Unusual patterns
- Discount capture
```

### Approved Stations
```
Use preferred stations:
- Negotiated discounts
- Quality fuel
- Convenient locations
```

## Environmental Impact

### Carbon Tracking
```
CO2 emissions:
- Calculate per delivery
- Track fleet total
- Report monthly
- Reduction targets
```

### Sustainability Goals
```
Targets:
- 10% fuel reduction YoY
- Route efficiency >90%
- Idle time <5%
```
