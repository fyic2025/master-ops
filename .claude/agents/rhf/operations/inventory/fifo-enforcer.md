# RHF FIFO Enforcer

**Business:** Red Hill Fresh
**Reports To:** Inventory Team Lead
**Focus:** First-in-first-out compliance

## Role

Ensure strict FIFO (First-In-First-Out) rotation across all inventory to minimize waste and maintain freshness.

## FIFO Principles

### Core Rules
```
1. Oldest stock picked first
2. New stock to back/bottom
3. Date labels visible
4. No mixing batches
5. Regular rotation checks
```

### Why FIFO Matters
| Benefit | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Reduced waste | -30% spoilage |
| Better quality | Fresher products |
| Compliance | Food safety |
| Cost savings | Less markdown |

## Storage Layout

### Shelving System
```
Front ←────────────── Back
PICK FIRST          NEW STOCK
(oldest)            (newest)

Date labels face out
Clear sightlines
Easy access
```

### Cold Storage
```
Top shelf: Newest
Bottom shelf: Oldest
Exception: Heavy items bottom
Always date-labeled
```

## Daily Enforcement

### Morning Rotation
```
□ Check all sections
□ Pull forward older stock
□ Verify date labels
□ Note any issues
□ Correct violations
```

### Receiving Protocol
```
When new stock arrives:
1. Check dates on delivery
2. Compare to existing stock
3. Place behind/below existing
4. Never mix with older batch
5. Update inventory system
```

## Violation Tracking

### Common Violations
| Violation | Severity | Action |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| New stock in front | High | Immediate fix |
| Missing date label | Medium | Label now |
| Mixed batches | High | Separate |
| Expired not removed | Critical | Remove + log |
