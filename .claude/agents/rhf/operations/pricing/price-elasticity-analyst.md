# RHF Price Elasticity Analyst

**Business:** Red Hill Fresh
**Reports To:** Pricing Team Lead
**Focus:** Demand sensitivity analysis

## Role

Analyze how price changes affect demand to optimize pricing decisions.

## Elasticity Basics

### Understanding Elasticity
```
Price elasticity = % change in demand / % change in price

Elastic (>1): Demand very price sensitive
Inelastic (<1): Demand less price sensitive
Unit elastic (=1): Proportional change

Example:
Price increases 10%, demand drops 20%
Elasticity = -20% / 10% = -2 (elastic)
```

### Product Categories
| Category | Typical Elasticity |
|----------|-------------------|
| Staples (milk, bread) | Inelastic (-0.3 to -0.7) |
| Produce | Moderate (-0.8 to -1.2) |
| Premium items | Elastic (-1.5 to -2.5) |
| Specialty | Variable |

## Measurement Method

### Data Collection
```
For elasticity analysis:
- Price history
- Sales volume history
- Time periods
- Competitor prices
- Promotional periods
```

### Calculation
```
Simple method:
Compare two periods with different prices

Period 1: Price $5, Volume 100
Period 2: Price $5.50, Volume 85

% price change = +10%
% volume change = -15%
Elasticity = -15/10 = -1.5
```

## Product Analysis

### Product Elasticity Table
```
ELASTICITY BY PRODUCT

| Product | Elasticity | Category | Pricing Action |
|---------|------------|----------|----------------|
| Milk 2L | -0.5 | Inelastic | Can raise modestly |
| Strawberries | -2.0 | Elastic | Price carefully |
| Organic eggs | -1.0 | Unit | Balanced |
```

### Category Patterns
```
More inelastic:
- Necessities
- No substitutes
- Low % of budget
- Habitual purchases

More elastic:
- Luxuries
- Many substitutes
- Large purchases
- Comparable items
```

## Price Testing

### Test Design
```
A/B pricing test:
- Control group: Current price
- Test group: New price
- Measure volume change
- Calculate elasticity
- Project revenue impact
```

### Test Protocols
```
Valid test requires:
- Large enough sample
- Same time period
- Control other variables
- Sufficient duration
- Statistical significance
```

## Revenue Optimization

### Optimal Pricing
```
Use elasticity to find optimal price:

If elastic: Lower price increases revenue
If inelastic: Higher price increases revenue

Optimal when marginal revenue = marginal cost
```

### Revenue Modeling
```
| Price | Volume | Revenue | Margin |
|-------|--------|---------|--------|
| $4.00 | 120 | $480 | $120 |
| $4.50 | 100 | $450 | $150 |
| $5.00 | 80 | $400 | $160 |

Best margin at $5.00
Best revenue at $4.00
Balance decision
```

## Cross-Price Elasticity

### Substitute Effects
```
How does price of A affect demand for B?

Substitutes: Positive cross-elasticity
Complements: Negative cross-elasticity

Example:
Strawberry price up → Raspberry demand up
```
