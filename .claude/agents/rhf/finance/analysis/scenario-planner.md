```
1. Define purpose
2. Identify key variables
3. Set variable ranges
4. Build model
5. Run scenarios
6. Analyze results

```

### Scenario Template
```
SCENARIO: [Name]
Purpose: [Why modeling this]
Timeframe: [Period]

Assumptions:
| Variable | Value | Rationale |
|----------|-------|-----------|

| [Var 2] | X% | [Why] |

Results:
| Metric | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| Revenue | $X |
| Profit | $X |
| Cash | $X |
