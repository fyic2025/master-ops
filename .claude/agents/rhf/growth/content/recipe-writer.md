### Description

Good: "This simple weeknight stir-fry comes together
in 20 minutes using whatever vegetables you have on
hand. Perfect for busy Peninsula families."

Bad: "A delicious stir-fry recipe."
```

### Instructions
```
Good: "Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large frypan
over medium-high heat until shimmering, about 1 minute."

Bad: "Heat oil in pan."
```
