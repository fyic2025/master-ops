| Exclusive | "Limited edition box" |

### Social Urgency

## Key Metrics

### Urgency Impact

| Conversion lift | +10-20% |
| Time to purchase | -30% |
| AOV impact | Monitor |
| Return rate | No increase |

## Ethical Guidelines

### Authentic Only
```
ALWAYS:
✓ Use real stock levels
✓ True delivery deadlines
✓ Genuine time limits
✓ Actual seasonal availability

NEVER:
✗ Fake countdown timers
✗ False scarcity
✗ Manipulative tactics
✗ Pressure that causes regret
```

### Trust Balance
```
Priority:
1. Customer trust
2. Long-term relationship
3. Short-term conversion

Test: Would this feel manipulative?
```

## RHF Natural Urgency

### Built-In Urgency
```
Fresh produce naturally has:
- Delivery cutoffs (real)
- Seasonal availability (real)
- Limited stock (real)
- Peak freshness windows (real)
```

### Leverage What's Real
```
"Order by 4pm Wednesday for Thursday delivery"
→ Real deadline, real consequence

"Strawberries: Peak season ends soon"
→ Genuine seasonality

"Only 12 boxes available this week"
→ Actual supply limitation
```

## Implementation Tactics

### Delivery Cutoff
```
Display:
- Countdown to cutoff
- "Order in next X hours for..."
- Clear delivery day result
```

### Stock Levels
| Level | Display |
|-------|---------|
| <5 | "Only X left" (red) |
| 5-15 | "Low stock" (yellow) |
| 15+ | Normal display |
| 0 | "Sold out" + notify option |

### Seasonal Messaging
```
For seasonal items:
"In season now - available until [month]"
"Last week for [product]"
"Just arrived: [seasonal item]"
```

## Page-Specific Tactics

### Product Page
```
Show:
- Stock level (if low)
- Delivery cutoff countdown
- Seasonal indicator
- Popular item badge
```

### Cart Page
```
Show:
- Cutoff reminder
- Low stock warnings
- Reserved time (if applicable)
- Free delivery threshold
```

### Email Urgency
```
Use in:
- Abandoned cart (cutoff)
- Weekly specials (expires)
- Seasonal alerts
- Flash sales
```

## Testing Ideas

### Priority Tests
| Test | Hypothesis |
|------|------------|
| Stock level display | Low stock increases urgency |
| Countdown timer | Increases cutoff orders |
| "Popular" badge | Social urgency converts |
| Seasonal end date | Accelerates purchase |

## Messaging Templates

### Cutoff Messages
```
"Order in the next 2h 15m for Thursday delivery"
"Today's cutoff: 4pm"
"Miss today? Next delivery is Tuesday"
```

### Scarcity Messages
```

"Limited availability - direct from farm"
"This week's allocation: 50 boxes"
```

### Social Urgency

"Popular in [Suburb]"
"Back by demand"
```

## Monitoring

### Watch For
```
Negative signals:
