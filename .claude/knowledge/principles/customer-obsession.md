# Customer Obsession Principles

*Source: Jeff Bezos - Amazon Leadership Principles*

## Core Philosophy

### Start with the Customer and Work Backwards
- Begin every initiative with the customer need
- Don't start with capabilities and find customers
- "What does the customer want?" not "What can we do?"

### Day 1 Mentality
- Act like a startup, regardless of size
- Maintain urgency and speed
- Avoid bureaucracy and process for process's sake
- Customer focus prevents Day 2 (stasis → decline)

### Long-Term Thinking
- Optimize for years, not quarters
- Sacrifice short-term gains for long-term value
- Build trust through consistency over time
- Invest in customer relationships

## Customer-Centric Decision Framework

### The Empty Chair
Imagine a customer sitting in every meeting:
- How would they react to this decision?
- Does this serve their interests?
- Would they be willing to pay for this?

### Working Backwards Process
1. Start with the press release (what will we announce?)
2. Write the FAQ (what will customers ask?)
3. Define the customer experience
4. Then figure out how to build it

### The 10x Test
- Would this be 10x better for the customer?
- If not, is it worth doing?
- Small improvements compound, but prioritize breakthroughs

## Customer Metrics to Track

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| NPS Score | Overall satisfaction and advocacy |
| Repeat Purchase Rate | Trust and product quality |
| Time to Resolution | Service quality |
| Churn Rate | Product-market fit |
| Review Sentiment | Qualitative satisfaction |

## Customer Obsession Checklist

Before launching anything:

- [ ] Have we validated this solves a real customer problem?
- [ ] Have we talked to actual customers?
- [ ] Is this significantly better than alternatives?
- [ ] Would customers pay for this?
- [ ] Does this build or erode trust?
- [ ] What's the customer's experience end-to-end?

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Competitor Obsession
- Don't let competitors define your strategy
- Focus on customers, not competitors
- Innovate for customers, not to match features

### 2. Metric Gaming
- Don't optimize metrics at customer expense
- Watch for proxy metrics that diverge from value
- Always ask "Is this good for the customer?"

### 3. Feature Creep
- More features ≠ more value
- Simple solutions to real problems win
- Complexity is customer-hostile

### 4. Short-Term Extraction
- Don't sacrifice trust for quick wins
- Build relationships, not transactions
- Earn the right to sell more

## Key Quotes

> "The most important single thing is to focus obsessively on the customer."

> "If we can keep our competitors focused on us while we stay focused on the customer, ultimately we'll turn out all right."

> "We see our customers as invited guests to a party, and we are the hosts."

> "If you're competitor-focused, you have to wait until there is a competitor doing something. Being customer-focused allows you to be more pioneering."

## Disagree and Commit

When customer data conflicts with intuition:
1. Present your case clearly
2. Listen to counterarguments
3. If overruled, commit fully anyway
4. Revisit decision at predetermined point
5. Let data settle the debate
