# Decision-Making Principles

*Source: Ray Dalio - Principles*

## Core Framework

### Radical Transparency
- Share information openly across the organization
- Make decision-making processes visible
- Document reasoning, not just outcomes
- Enable anyone to challenge ideas on merit

### Believability-Weighted Decisions
- Not all opinions are equal
- Weight by track record and demonstrated expertise
- Those who have done it successfully get more weight
- But always consider thoughtful dissent

### Pain + Reflection = Progress
- Mistakes are learning opportunities
- Document failures thoroughly (post-mortems)
- Extract principles from painful experiences
- Apply learnings to prevent recurrence

## Decision Process

### 1. Identify the Decision
- What exactly are we deciding?
- What are the constraints?
- Who needs to be involved?
- What's the deadline?

### 2. Gather Information
- What data do we have?
- What data do we need?
- Who has relevant expertise?
- What have we tried before?

### 3. Consider Alternatives
- Generate multiple options
- Include "do nothing" as an option
- Consider second-order effects
- Think about reversibility

### 4. Apply Believability Weights
- Whose opinion matters most here?
- What's their track record on similar decisions?
- Are experts in agreement or divided?
- What does the data say?

### 5. Decide and Document
- Make the call
- Document the reasoning
- Set success criteria
- Define review points

### 6. Review and Learn
- Did it work as expected?
- What would we do differently?
- Update principles if needed
- Share learnings

## Decision Quality Checklist

Before making significant decisions:

- [ ] Have I clearly defined the problem?
- [ ] Have I gathered sufficient data?
- [ ] Have I consulted believable people?
- [ ] Have I considered alternatives?
- [ ] Have I thought about second-order effects?
- [ ] Can this decision be reversed if wrong?
- [ ] Have I documented my reasoning?
- [ ] Have I set review criteria?

## Common Decision Traps to Avoid

### 1. Anchoring
Don't let the first piece of information dominate

### 2. Confirmation Bias
Actively seek disconfirming evidence

### 3. Sunk Cost Fallacy
Past investment doesn't justify future investment

### 4. Recency Bias
Don't overweight recent events

### 5. Analysis Paralysis
Set decision deadlines and stick to them

## When to Escalate

Escalate decisions when:
- Impact exceeds your authority level
- You lack expertise in the domain
- Stakeholders disagree significantly
- The decision is irreversible
- It involves significant spend
