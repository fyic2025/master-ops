# Leverage Principles

*Source: Naval Ravikant*

## The Three Forms of Leverage

### 1. Labor (People)
- Oldest form of leverage
- Linear scaling (more people = more output)
- Management overhead increases with scale
- Limited by coordination costs

### 2. Capital (Money)
- Multiplies impact of decisions
- Requires permission (from investors, lenders)
- Amplifies both gains and losses
- Good capital allocation is a superpower

### 3. Products with Zero Marginal Cost
- Code (software)
- Media (content)
- No permission needed
- Scales infinitely
- **This is the most powerful form today**

## Code as Leverage

Software is leverage because:
- Build once, deploy infinitely
- Runs 24/7 without management
- No marginal cost per user
- Compounds over time

### Applying to Our Business

| System | Leverage It Provides |
|--------|---------------------|
| Agent Team | Automates decision-making and execution |
| n8n Workflows | Automates repetitive operations |
| Dashboard | Scales visibility without manual reporting |
| Integrations | Connects systems without manual data entry |

## Specific Knowledge

> "Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now."

### What Makes Knowledge Specific:
- Can't be easily taught or outsourced
- Comes from lived experience
- Combines multiple disciplines uniquely
- Builds over years of focused effort

### Our Specific Knowledge:
- E-commerce operations across multiple platforms
- Health/wellness product market understanding
- Australian market nuances
- Multi-business orchestration with AI

## Judgment

> "Wisdom is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions."

### Developing Judgment:
- Learn from both successes and failures
- Seek out edge cases and exceptions
- Understand second and third-order effects
- Build mental models across domains

### When to Apply Judgment vs. Rules:
| Use Rules When | Use Judgment When |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Situation is well-defined | Situation is novel |
| Stakes are low | Stakes are high |
| Speed matters most | Quality matters most |
| Consistency is key | Context is unique |

## Compounding

> "All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest."

### Time Horizons:
- Most people overestimate 1 year
- Most people underestimate 10 years
- Play long-term games with long-term people

### Compounding in Our Context:
- Customer relationships compound (LTV)
- Brand equity compounds
- Knowledge base compounds
- Agent improvements compound

## Accountability

> "Embrace accountability and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage."

### Accountability Enables:
- Ownership of outcomes
- Direct feedback loops
- Credibility that compounds
- Opportunity for outsized returns

## Applying Leverage Principles

### Priority Order for Leverage:
1. **Automate** - Can code do this?
2. **Delegate** - Can an agent do this?
3. **Outsource** - Can a service do this?
4. **Do yourself** - Only if above fail

### Questions to Ask:
- Am I trading time for money? (avoid)
- Does this scale without me? (good)
- Am I building something that compounds? (great)
- Is this leveraging specific knowledge? (excellent)

## Key Quotes

> "Give me a lever long enough and a fulcrum on which to place it, and I shall move the world." - Archimedes

> "Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich."

> "You're not going to get rich renting out your time."

> "Play long-term games with long-term people."

> "Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for."

## Daily Application

Before taking on work:
1. Can I automate this completely?
2. If not, can I automate part of it?
3. Will this create reusable assets?
4. Does this build specific knowledge?
5. Is this a long-term or short-term play?
