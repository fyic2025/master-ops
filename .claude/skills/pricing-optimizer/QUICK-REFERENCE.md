## Quick Formulas

**Selling Price:**
```
Price = Cost / (1 - Margin%)
$10 cost @ 50% margin = $20
```

**Margin %:**
```
Margin = (Price - Cost) / Price × 100
($25 - $10) / $25 = 60%
```

**Markup to Margin:**
```
50% markup = 33% margin
100% markup = 50% margin
150% markup = 60% margin
```

**Discount Impact:**
```
20% off @ 50% margin = need 67% more sales
