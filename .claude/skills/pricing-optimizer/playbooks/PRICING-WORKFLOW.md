# Pricing Workflow

## Price Setting Process

### Step 1: Cost Analysis

**Gather cost data:**
```
[ ] Purchase/manufacturing cost
[ ] Inbound freight
[ ] Import duties (if applicable)
[ ] Warehousing allocation
[ ] Handling costs
[ ] Payment processing (2-3%)
[ ] Platform fees
[ ] Returns allowance
```

**Calculate landed cost:**
```
Landed Cost = Purchase + Freight + Duties + Handling
Operating Cost = Payment % + Platform % + Returns %
Total Cost = Landed Cost + (Price × Operating Cost %)
```

### Step 2: Market Analysis

**Research competitors:**
```
[ ] Identify 3-5 direct competitors
[ ] Capture their prices
[ ] Note their positioning
[ ] Check for promotions
[ ] Assess value differences
```

**Determine position:**
- Below market: Volume strategy
- At market: Competitive parity
- Above market: Premium/differentiation

### Step 3: Margin Calculation

**Set target margin:**
```
Reference targets:
- Category standard margin
- Business minimum margin
- Desired profitability
```

**Calculate price:**
```
Price = Total Cost / (1 - Target Margin %)
```

### Step 4: Price Optimization

**Psychological pricing:**
- $19.99 vs $20.00
- $24.95 vs $25.00
- Round numbers for premium

**Consistency check:**
- Align with product range
- Check bundle opportunities
- Verify against MAP

### Step 5: Implementation

**Update all channels:**
```
[ ] Primary platform (BC/Shopify/WC)
[ ] Marketplace listings
[ ] Comparison shopping feeds
[ ] Price files for distributors
[ ] Marketing materials
```

- Prepare for customer questions

**Large increase (15%+):**

- Implement gradually if possible

### Monitoring

## Competitor Price Response

### When Competitor Drops Price

**Step 1: Assess**
- Is it permanent or promotion?
- How significant is the difference?
- How important is the product?
- What's their margin position?

**Step 2: Decide**
| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Temporary sale | Hold price |
| Small difference (<5%) | Monitor |
| Significant (5-15%) | Consider matching |
| Large (>15%) | Differentiate |

**Step 3: Act**
- Match: If product is price-sensitive commodity
- Differentiate: Bundle, service, quality emphasis
- Ignore: If positioning justifies premium
- Wait: If likely temporary

### When to Match

- Product is commodity/interchangeable
- Customer actively comparing
- Significant volume at stake
- Still profitable at lower price

### When to Hold

- Strong brand preference
- Unique features/quality
- Good customer loyalty
- Competitor pricing unsustainable

## Bundle Pricing

### Bundle Strategy

**Goals:**
- Increase average order value
- Move slow sellers
- Create perceived value
- Reduce comparison shopping

### Bundle Types

| Type | Structure | Discount |
|------|-----------|----------|
| Product Bundle | Related products | 10-15% |
| Volume Bundle | Same product × N | 15-20% |
| Mix & Match | Choose from set | 10-15% |
| Starter Kit | Entry point | 15-20% |
| Gift Set | Premium presentation | 5-10% |

### Bundle Pricing Formula

```
Bundle Price = Sum of Items × (1 - Bundle Discount)

Example:
Item A: $30
Item B: $25
Item C: $20
Sum: $75
Bundle Price @ 15% off: $63.75
```

### Margin Protection

```
Bundle margin floor:
- Never below category minimum
- Target 5% below standard margin
- Account for packaging costs
```

|--------|--------|--------|
| Summer | Standard pricing | Dec-Feb |
