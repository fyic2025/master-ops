## Phase 3: Description Structure

### Short Description (50-100 words)

```
Structure:
1. Opening hook (benefit-led)
2. Key product identifier
3. Primary benefit statement
4. Call to action or usage hint

Example (BOO):
"Nourish your body with nature's most potent superfood.
Organic Spirulina Powder is packed with plant-based protein,
iron, and B vitamins to support your energy levels naturally.
Simply add a teaspoon to your morning smoothie for a
nutrient boost that keeps you going all day."
```

### Long Description (200-400 words)

```
Structure:
1. Compelling introduction (2-3 sentences)
2. Key benefits section (3-5 bullet points)
3. Quality/sourcing story (1 paragraph)
4. Usage suggestions (1 paragraph)
5. Certifications/trust signals
6. Subtle CTA

Formatting:
- Use subheadings for scannability
- Break into short paragraphs
- Include bullet points for benefits
- Bold key terms sparingly
```

### SEO Meta Description (150-160 chars)

```
Formula: [Primary Keyword] + [Key Benefit] + [Trust Signal/CTA]

Example:
"Shop organic spirulina powder - certified organic,
rich in protein & iron. Australian owned. Free shipping over $99."
```

## Phase 4: SEO Optimization

### Keyword Integration

```
Primary Keyword Placement:
[x] Product title (first 60 chars)
[x] Meta description
[x] First paragraph of description
[x] One H2 or H3 heading
[x] Image alt text

Secondary Keywords:
- Sprinkle naturally 2-3 times
- Use in bullet points
- Include in feature descriptions
```

### Keyword Density Guidelines

| Description Length | Primary Keyword | Secondary Keywords |
|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Short (100 words) | 1-2 times | 1 time each |
| Medium (250 words) | 2-3 times | 1-2 times each |
| Long (400 words) | 3-4 times | 2-3 times each |
