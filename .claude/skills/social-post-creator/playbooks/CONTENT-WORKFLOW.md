## Phase 2: Writing

### Step 1: Hook Creation

**Write 3 hook options:**

```
Option A (Question):
[Question that addresses pain point or curiosity]

Option B (Statement):
[Bold statement or interesting fact]

Option C (Number):
[Numbered list or statistic]
```

**Test: Does it pass the scroll test?**
- Would this make you stop scrolling?
- Is it clear what value you'll get?
- Does it create curiosity?

### Step 2: Body Content

**Structure based on post type:**

**Educational:**
```
[Hook]

[Main point 1]
[Main point 2]
[Main point 3]

[Summary or key takeaway]
```

**Product Feature:**
```
[Hook - benefit focused]

[What it is]

[Benefits]:
✓ Benefit 1
✓ Benefit 2
✓ Benefit 3

[Why it matters]
```

**Story/Personal:**
```
[Hook - intriguing opening]

[Setup - context]

[Challenge/tension]

[Resolution/lesson]

[Application for reader]
```

### Step 3: Call to Action

**Match CTA to goal:**

```
Engagement goal:
"What's your experience with [topic]?"
"Which one would you choose?"
"Tag someone who needs to see this"

Save goal:
"Save this for later 📌"
"Bookmark for your next [activity]"

Traffic goal:
"Link in bio for more"
"Comment [word] for the link"

Sales goal:
"Shop now via link in bio"
"Limited stock - grab yours today"
```

### Step 4: Hashtag Selection

**Choose hashtag mix:**

```
[2-3 Large hashtags - 500K+ posts]
[5-8 Medium hashtags - 50K-500K posts]
[3-5 Small hashtags - under 50K posts]

Example for organic product:
Large: #organic #healthylifestyle #wellness
Medium: #organiclifestyle #healthfood #superfoodpowder
Small: #organicaustralia #certifiedorganicau #cleanpantry
```
